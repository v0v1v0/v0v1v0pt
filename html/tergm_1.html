<h2>Fit, Simulate and Diagnose Dynamic Network Models derived from
Exponential-Family Random Graph Models</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>tergm</code> is a collection of extensions to the
<code>ergm</code> package to fit, diagnose, and simulate
models for dynamic networks — networks that evolve over time — based on
exponential-family random graph models (ERGMs). For a list of functions type
<code>help(package='tergm')</code>
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>When publishing results obtained using this package, please cite the
original authors as described in <code>citation(package="tergm")</code>.
</p>
<p>All programs derived from this package must cite it.
</p>
<p>An exponential-family random graph model (ERGM) postulates an exponential
family over the sample space of networks of interest, and
<code>ergm</code> package implements a suite of tools for
modeling single networks using ERGMs.
</p>
<p>There have been a number of extensions of ERGMs for modeling the evolution
of networks, including the temporal ERGM (TERGM) of Hanneke et al. (2010)
and the separable termporal ERGM (STERGM) of Krivitsky and Handcock (2014).
The latter model allows familiar ERGM terms and statistics to be reused in a
dynamic context, interpreted in terms of formation and dissolution
(persistence) of ties. Krivitsky (2012) suggested a method for fitting
dynamic models when only a cross-sectional network is available, provided
some temporal information for it is available as well.
</p>
<p>This package aims to implement these and other ERGM-based models for network
evolution. At this time, it implements, via the <code>tergm</code>
function, a general framework for modeling tie dynamics in temporal networks
with flexible model specification (including (S)TERGMs).  Estimation options
include a conditional MLE (CMLE) approach for fitting to a series of
networks and an Equilibrium Generalized Method of Moments Estimation (EGMME)
for fitting to a single network with temporal information. For further
development, see the referenced papers.
</p>


<h3>Temporal model specification in <span class="pkg">tergm</span>
</h3>

<p>The operator terms implemented by <span class="pkg">tergm</span> are <code>Form()</code>,
<code>Persist()</code>, <code>Diss()</code>, <code>Cross()</code>, and <code>Change()</code>.  These are used
to specify how the <code>ergm</code> terms (<code>ergmTerm</code>) in a formula are
evaluated across a network time-series.  Note, you cannot use one
of these operators within another temporal, so
<code>Cross(~Form(~edges))</code> is not a valid specification. (Generally,
nesting these operators within other operators will often not work;
nesting other operators within them will almost always work,
however.)
</p>
<p>The durational terms are distinguished either by their name,
<code>mean.age</code>, or their name extensions: <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠&lt;name&gt;.ages⁠</code>,
<code style="white-space: pre;">⁠&lt;name&gt;.mean.age⁠</code>, and <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠&lt;name&gt;.age.interval⁠</code>.  In contrast to
their eponymous terms in <span class="pkg">ergm</span>, these durational
terms take into account the elapsed time since each (term-relevant) dyad in
the network was last toggled.
</p>
<p>As currently implemented, the package does not support use of many
durational terms during estimation, though it may work with some.
But durational terms may be used as targets, monitors, or summary
statistics.  The ability to use these terms in the estimation of
models is under development.
</p>


<h3>Compatibility with previous versions</h3>

<p>If you previously used the <code>stergm()</code> function in this package, please
note that <code>stergm()</code> has been superceded by the new <code>tergm</code>
function, and has been deprecated.  The
<code>dissolution</code> formula in <code>stergm()</code> maps to the new <code>Persist()</code>
operator in the <code>tergm()</code> function, <strong>not</strong> the <code>Diss()</code> operator.
