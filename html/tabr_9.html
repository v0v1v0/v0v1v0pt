<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Note: When working with special <code>tabr</code> classes, you can simply use generics
like <code>c()</code> and <code>rep()</code> as many custom methods exist for these classes. The
additional respective helper functions, <code>pc()</code> and <code>pn()</code>, are more
specifically for phrase objects and when you are still working with character
strings, yet to be converted to a phrase object (numbers not yet in string
form are allowed). See examples.
</p>
<p>The functions <code>pc()</code> and <code>pn()</code> are based on base functions <code>paste()</code> and
<code>rep()</code>, respectively, but are tailored for efficiency in creating musical
phrases.
</p>
<p>These functions respect and retain the phrase class when applied to phrases.
They are aggressive for phrases and secondarily for noteworthy strings.
Combining a phrase with a non-phrase string will assume compatibility and
result in a new phrase object.
If no phrase objects are present, the presence of any noteworthy string will
in turn attempt to force conversion of all strings to noteworthy strings.
The aggressiveness provides convenience, but is counter to expected coercion
rules. It is up to the user to ensure all inputs can be forced into the more
specific child class.
</p>
<p>This is especially useful for repeated instances. This function applies to
general slur notation as well.
Multiple input formats are allowed. Total number of note durations must be
even because all slurs require start and stop points.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>phrase on non-phrase character string, noteworthy string if
applicable.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">pc(8, "16-", "8^")
pn(1, 2)
x &lt;- phrase("c ec'g' ec'g'", "4 4 2", "5 432 432")
y &lt;- phrase("a", 1, 5)
pc(x, y)
pc(x, pn(y, 2))
pc(x, "r1") # add a simple rest instance
class(pc(x, y))
class(pn(y, 2))
class(pc(x, "r1"))
class(pn("r1", 2))
class(pc("r1", "r4"))
</code></pre>
