<h2>Look up state and county codes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Function to look up the FIPS codes for states and optionally counties you'd l
ike to load data for.  As the package functions require the codes to return
the data correctly, this function makes it easy to find the codes that you need.
</p>

</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">

Accepts state names (spelled correctly), e.g. "Texas", or
postal codes, e.g. "TX". Can be lower-case.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>county</code></td>
<td>
<p>The name of the county you'll like to search for.  T
he state that the county is located in must be supplied for this to
work, as there are multiple counties with the same names across states.
Can be lower-case.</p>
</td>
</tr>
