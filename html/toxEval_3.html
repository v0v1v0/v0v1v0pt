<h2>clean_endPoint_info</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Define a subset of the ToxCast database for relevance to toxEval analyses.
Subsetting is done based upon methods defined by Blackwell et al., 2017 (
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.7b01613">doi:10.1021/acs.est.7b01613</a>).
Specifically, this function removes endPoints that are ATG sources with
signal loss, and NVS with signal gain (basically: some assay/signal combinations
are removed because they target non-specific endpoints). Also, this function adds additional
categories to intended_target_family and intended_target_family_sub as
described in the paper linked above.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">clean_endPoint_info(end_point_info)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>end_point_info</code></td>
<td>
<p>Data frame Endpoint information from ToxCast.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The returned data frame is based on end_point_info, but with some endPoints
filtered out and some additional categories in intended_target_family and
intended_target_family_sub. The names in intended_target_family
are revised to look more appealing in graphs and tables.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">end_point_info &lt;- end_point_info
nrow(end_point_info)
cleaned_ep &lt;- clean_endPoint_info(end_point_info)
nrow(cleaned_ep)
</code></pre>
