<h2>Turnable laser measurements from Bellcore</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data came from an investigation of an experimental laser at Bellcore.
It was a tunable laser, in the sense that both its wavelength and power
output were controllable.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A 64 x 4 numeric array
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Rotation helped the experimental physicists to characterize the laser, which
turned out not to be a very good one, due to its unstable operating region.
</p>
<p>This data initially came to the statistics research group when Janette
Cooper asked Paul Tukey to help her analyze the data she had collected to
describe the laser.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> ifront, current applied to the front of the laser
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> iback, current applied to the back of the laser
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> power, output power
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> lambda, output wavelength
</p>
</li>
</ul>
