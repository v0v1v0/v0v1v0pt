<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Lorge and Curtiss (1936) examined how a quotation is perceived when
it is attributed to a liked or disliked individual. The quotation of interest
was: "I hold it that a little rebellion, now and then, is a good thing, and
as necessary in the political world as storms are in the physical world."
In one condition the quotation was attributed to Thomas Jefferson, a liked
individual, and in the other condition it was attributed to Vladimir Lenin, a
disliked individual. More agreement was observed when the quotation was
attributed to Jefferson than Lenin. In the replication studies, the quotation
was: "I have sworn to only live free, even if I find bitter the taste of
death." This quotation was attributed to either George Washington, the
liked individual, or Osama Bin Laden, the disliked individual.
