<h2>Compare object with object stored in a file</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Compares the current value with a value stored to file with
<code>saveRDS</code>.  If the  file does not exist, the current value is
stored into file, and the test returns <code>expect_null(NULL)</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">expect_equal_to_reference(current, file, ...)

expect_equivalent_to_reference(current, file, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>current</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>[R object or expression]</code> Outcome or expression under 
scrutiny.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>file</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>[character]</code> File where the <code>target</code> is stored. If 
<code>file</code> does not exist, <code>current</code> will be stored there.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>passed to <code>expect_equal</code>, respectively <code>expect_equivalent</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Be aware that on CRAN it is not allowed to write data to user space. So make
sure that the file is either stored with your tests, or generated with
<code>tempfile</code>, or the test is skipped on CRAN, using
<code>at_home</code>.
</p>
<p><code>build_install_test</code> clones the package and
builds and tests it in a separate R session in the background. This means
that if you create a file located at <code>tempfile()</code> during the run, this
file is destroyed when the separate R session is closed.

<code>expect_equal()</code>,
<code>expect_length()</code>,
<code>expect_match()</code>,
<code>ignore()</code>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">filename &lt;- tempfile()
# this gives TRUE: the file does not exist, but is created now.
expect_equal_to_reference(1, file=filename)
# this gives TRUE: the file now exists, and its contents is equal
# to the current value
expect_equal_to_reference(1, file=filename)
# this gives FALSE: the file exists, but is contents is not equal
# to the current value
expect_equal_to_reference(2, file=filename)
