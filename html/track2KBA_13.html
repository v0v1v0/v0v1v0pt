<h2>Assess sample representativeness</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>repAssess</code> estimates the degree to which the space use of a tracked
sample of animals represents that of the larger population.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">repAssess(
  tracks,
  KDE = NULL,
  iteration = 1,
  levelUD,
  avgMethod = "mean",
  nCores = 1,
  bootTable = FALSE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tracks</code></td>
<td>
<p>SpatialPointsDataFrame of spatially projected animal
relocations. Must include 'ID' field.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>KDE</code></td>
<td>
<p>Kernel Density Estimates for individual animals. Several input
options: an estUDm, a SpatialPixels/GridDataFrame, or a RasterStack.
If estUDm, must be as created by <code>estSpaceUse</code> or
<code>adehabitatHR::kernelUD</code>, if Spatial* each column should correspond to
the Utilization Distribution of a single individual or track. If a
RasterStack, each layer must be an individual UD.</p>

</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>iteration</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric. Number of times to repeat sub-sampling procedure.
The higher the iterations, the more robust the result.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>levelUD</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric. Specify which contour of the utilization distribution
(<code>KDE</code>) you wish to filter to (e.g. core area=50, home range=95).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>avgMethod</code></td>
<td>
<p>character. Choose whether to use the arithmetic or weighted
mean when combining individual IDs. Options are :'mean' arithmetic mean, or
'weighted', which weights each UD by the numner of points per level of ID.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nCores</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric. The number of processing cores to use. For heavy
operations, the higher the faster. NOTE: CRAN sets a maximum at 2 cores. If
using the git-hub version of the package, this can be set to a maximum of one
fewer than the maximum cores in your computer.</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>bootTable</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical (TRUE/FALSE). If TRUE, output is a list, containing
in the first slot the representativeness results summarized in a table, and
in the second the full results of the iterated inclusion calculations.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Representativeness is assessed by fitting statistical model to the
relationship between sample size and inclusion rate. Incusion rate is the
proportion of out-sample points included in in-sample space use areas.
</p>
<p>First, the set of IDs is iteratively sub-sampled, and in each iteration a set
of individual Utilization Distributions (UD, 'KDE' argument) are pooled and
the points of the un-selected (out-sample) IDs are overlaid on the 
area ('levelUD') of the UD. The proportion of these outsample points which
overlap the pooled UD area is known as the inclusion rate, and represents
an estimate of representativeness at each sample size. Then, a non-linear
function is fit to the relationship between the inclusion rate and sample
size (i.e. number of tracks/animals) in order to estimate the point at which
the relationship reaches an asymptote (i.e. no more information added per
new track). <code>repAssess</code> then estimates the representativeness of the
sample by dividing the inclusion rate estimated at the maximum sample size
minus 3 (for samples where n &lt; 20), 2 (for samples &lt; 50) or 1 (for sample
&gt;100) by this asymptote. The maximum sample size appearing in the plot
will be different than the true 'n' of the dataset in order to account for
the possible number of combinations of individuals, thereby ensuring a
robust result. The maximum sample size reflects the number of KDEs, so if
any ID has fewer than 5 points, this ID is omitted from the analysis.
Finally, using this relationship, minimum representative sample sizes

<p><code>repAssess</code> accepts UDs calculated outside of <code>track2KBA</code>,
if they have been converted to class <code>RasterStack</code> or
<code>SpatialPixelsDataFrame</code>. However, one must make sure that the cell
values represent continuous probability densities (i.e. values &gt;=0 which
integrate to 1 over the raster) and not not discrete probability masses
(i.e. values &gt;=0 which sum to 1), nor home range quantiles (i.e. 0-1, or
0-100 representing 
</p>
<p>When setting <code>avgMethod</code> care must be taken. If the number of points
differ greatly among individuals and the UDs are calculated as classic
KDEs (e.g. from <code>estSpaceUse</code>) then the weighted mean is likely
the optimal way to pool individual UDs. However, if any other method (for
example AKDE, auto-correlated KDE) was used to estimate UDs, then the
arithmetic mean is the safer option.
</p>
<p>NOTE: this function does not work with fewer than 4 IDs (tracks or
individual animals).

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>if <code>bootTable=FALSE</code> (the default) A single-row data.frame is
returned, with columns '<em>SampleSize</em>' signifying the sample size (i.e.,
number of KDEs)'<em>out</em>' signifying the percent representativeness of the
sample,'<em>type</em>' is the type  of asymptote value used to calculate the
'<em>out</em>' value, and '<em>asym</em>' is the asymptote value used.
If <code>bootTable=TRUE</code>, a list returned with above dataframe in first slot
and full iteration results in second slot.
</p>
<p>There are two potential values for '<em>type</em>':'asymptote' is
the ideal, where the asymptote value is calculated from the parameter
estimates of the successful nls model fit. 'inclusion' is used if the nls
fails to converge, or if the fit model is flipped and the asymptote value
is negative.  In these casess, the mean inclusion rate is taken for the
largest sample size.'Rep70' signifies the sample size which is ~70
representative, and 'Rep95' signifies the sample
size which approahces the asymptote.
