<h2>Correct ordering of Taylor Swift's albums</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Easily create a factor variable for Taylor Swift's albums. Rather than
specifying each album individually, you can use this shortcut vector that has
already specified the ordering.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">album_levels
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A vector of length 15. Each element is an album
name, in an order that can be used for making factor variables.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Albums are listed in release order, with one notable exception. The
"Taylor's Version" releases are list directly following the original. That
is, <em>Fearless (Taylor's Version)</em> comes directly after <em>Fearless</em>, rather
than after <em>evermore</em>, when it was released. This is because
"Taylor's Version" is often a stand-in for the original, as in
<code>taylor_album_songs</code>. Thus, it more often makes more sense for the album to
be placed with the original, rather than in the actual release order.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">library(ggplot2)
studio_albums &lt;- subset(taylor_albums, !ep)

# by default, albums get plotted in alphabetical order
ggplot(studio_albums, aes(x = metacritic_score, y = album_name)) +
  geom_col()

# use `album_levels` to create a sensible factor variable
studio_albums$album_name &lt;- factor(studio_albums$album_name,
                                   levels = album_levels)
ggplot(studio_albums, aes(x = metacritic_score, y = album_name)) +
  geom_col()
</code></pre>
