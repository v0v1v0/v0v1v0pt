<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Inferential statitics are generated by comparing the observed difference
between the actual treated unit and its synthetic control to each placebo
unit and its synthetic control. The rarity of the actual to the placebo is
used to infer the likelihood of observing the effect.
</p>
<p>Inference in this framework leverages the mean squared predictive error
(MSPE) of the fit in the pre-period to the fit in the post-period as a ratio.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\frac{RMSE_{Post}}{RMSE_{Pre}}</code>
</p>

<p>The ratio captures the differences between the pre-intervention fit and the
post-intervention divergence of the trend (i.e. the causal quantity). A good
fit in the pre-period denotes that the observed and synthetic case tracked
well together. Divergence in the post-period captures the difference brought
about by the intervention in the two trends. Thus, when the ratio is high, we
observe more of a difference between the two trends. If, however, the
pre-period fit is poor, or there is not substantial divergence in the
post-period, then this ratio amount will be smaller.
</p>
<p>The Fisher's Exact P-Value is generated by ranking the ratios for the treated
and placebo units. The P-Value is then calculated by dividing the rank of the
case over the total (rank/total). The case with the highest RMSE ratio is
rare given the distribution of cases as generated by the placebo. A more
detailed outline of inference within the synthetic control framework can be
found in Adabie et al. 2010.
</p>
<p>Note that conventional significance levels are not achievable if there is an
insufficient number of control cases. One needs at least 20 control case to
use the conventional .05 level. With fewer cases, significance levels need to
be adjusted to accommodate the low total rank. This is a bug of rank based
significance metrics.
</p>
<p>In addition to the Fisher's Precise P-Value, a Z-score is also included,
which is just the standardized RMSE ratios for all the cases. The Z-Score
captures the degree to which a particular case's RMSE ratio deviates from the
distribution of the placebo cases.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>tibble data frame containing the following fields:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>unit_name</code>: name of the unit
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>type</code>: treated or donor unit (placebo)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>pre_mspe</code>: pre-intervention period means squared predictive error
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>post_mspe</code>: post-intervention period means squared predictive error
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>mspe_ratio</code>: post_mspe/pre_mspe; captures the difference in fit in the
pre and post period. A good fit in the pre-period and a poor fit in the
post-period reflects a meaningful effect when comparing the difference
between the observed outcome and the synthetic control.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>rank</code>: rank order of the mspe_ratio.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>fishers_exact_pvalue</code>: rank/total to generate a p-value. Conventional
levels aren't achievable if there isn't a sufficient number of controls to
generate a large enough ranking. Need at least 20 control units to use the
conventional .05 level.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>z_score</code>: (mspe_ratio-mean(mspe_ratio))/sd(mspe_ratio); captures the
degree to which the mspe_ratio of the treated unit deviates from the mean
of the placebo units. Provinding an alternative significance determination.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
