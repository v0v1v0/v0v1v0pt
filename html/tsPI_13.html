<h2>Improved Prediction Intervals for ARIMA Processes and Structural Time Series</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Package tsPI computes prediction intervals for ARIMA and structural
time series models by using importance sampling approach with uninformative priors
for model parameters, leading to more accurate coverage probabilities in frequentist sense.
Instead of sampling the future observations and hidden states
of the state space representation of the model, only model parameters are sampled,
and the method is based solving the equations corresponding to the conditional
coverage probability of the prediction intervals. This makes method relatively
fast compared to for example MCMC methods, and standard errors of prediction
limits can also be computed straightforwardly.
