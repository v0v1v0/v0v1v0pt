<h2> Facebook-like Online Social Network </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This network is the Facebook-like Social Network-dataset used in my Ph.D. thesis. This network has also been described in Patterns and Dynamics of Users' Behaviour and Interaction: Network Analysis of an Online Community and used in Prominence and control: The weighted rich-club effect and Clustering in weighted networks. The network originates from a virtual community among students at University of California, Irvine. The edgelists include the users that sent or received at least one message during that period (1,899). A total number of 59,835 online messages were sent among over 20,296 directed ties.</p>
