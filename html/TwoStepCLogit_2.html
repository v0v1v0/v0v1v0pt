<p>Bison data collected in Prince Albert National Park, Saskatchewan, Canada 
(Craiu et al. 2011).
</p>

<dd>
<p>pair of animals (dyad) ID</p>
</dd>
<dt>Strata</dt>
<dd>
<p>stratum ID</p>
</dd> 
<dt>Y</dt>
<dd>
<p>response variable: 1 for visited locations, 0 otherwise</p>
</dd> 
<dt>water</dt>
<dd>
<p>land cover indicator covariate: 1 for water, 0 otherwise</p>
</dd> 
<dt>agric</dt>

</dd> 
<dt>meadow</dt>
<dd>
<p>land cover indicator covariate: 1 for meadows, 0 otherwise</p>
</dd>
<dt>biomass</dt>
<dd>
<p>continuous covariate: above-ground vegetation biomass index measured
(in <code class="reqn">kg/m^2</code>) only at locations within meadows, 0 otherwise</p>
</dd>
<dt>pmeadow</dt>
<dd>
<p>continuous covariate: the proportion of meadow in a circular plot 
(700 m in radius) centered at the bison's location</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This data set was collected in order to study habitat selection by groups
of free-ranging bison. For each observed group, two individuals (dyad) equipped with GPS 
radio-collars were followed simultaneously. A cluster is defined here as a pair of bison. 
This data set contains 20 clusters. The number of strata per cluster varies
between 13 and 345 for a total of 1410 strata. A stratum is composed of two visited GPS
locations (one for each individual) gathered at the same time, together with 10 
random locations (five drawn within 700 m of each of the two focal bison). Therefore,
there are 12 observations per stratum, with 2 cases (Y=1) and 10 controls (Y=0).
However, due to problems in the data collection, 17 of the 1410 strata have only 6 
observations (1 case and 5 controls).
