<h2>TempStable: A collection of methods to estimate parameters of different
tempered stable distributions.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A collection of methods to estimate parameters of different tempered stable
distributions. Currently, there are three different tempered stable
distributions to choose from: Tempered stable subordinator distribution,
classical tempered stable distribution, normal tempered stable distribution.
The package also provides functions to compute characteristic functions and
tools to run Monte Carlo simulations.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The package was developed by Till Massing and Cedric Juessen and is
structurally based on the "StableEstim" package by Tarak Kharrat and Georgi
N. Boshnakov.
</p>


<h3>Brief description of functions</h3>

<p><strong>TemperedEstim()</strong> <code>TemperedEstim()</code>computes all the information about the
estimator. It allows the user to choose the preferred method and several
related options.
</p>
<p>Characteristic function, density function, probability function and other
functions for every tempered stable distribution mentioned above.
E.g. <code>charTSS()</code>, <code>dCTS()</code>, ...
</p>
<p><strong>Monte Carlo simulation:</strong> a tool to run a Monte Carlo simulation
<code>TemperedEstim_Simulation()</code> is provided and can save output files or
produce statistical summary.To parallelize this function, you can use
<code>parallelizeMCsimulation()</code>.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## basic example code
# Such a simulation can take a very long time. Therefore, it can make sense
# to parallelize after Monte Carlo runs. Parallelization of the simulation is
# now possible with [parallelizeMCsimulation()].

# For testing purposes, the amount of runs and parameters is greatly reduced.
# Therefore, the result is not meaningful. To start a meaningful simulation,
# the SampleSize could be, for example, 1000 and MCParam also 1000.
