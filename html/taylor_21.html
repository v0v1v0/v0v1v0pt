</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p><code>taylor_album_songs</code> is a tibble containing

240 rows, one for each song from an official studio
album (see Details).
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>taylor_all_songs</code> contains all songs in Taylor's discography.
Lyrics come from Genius, and songs characteristics come from the Spotify API.
Some data is known to be missing. The Beautiful Eyes EP is not available on
any streaming service, and therefore has no data from the Spotify API.
Similarly, the song <em>American Girl</em>, a cover of the Tom Petty original, was
released exclusively on Rhapsody (now Napster), and therefore also does not
have data from the Spotify API.
</p>
<p>For songs released separately from Taylor's official albums or EPs, album
information is not included. For example, <em>I Don't Wanna Live Forever</em> was
released as part of the <em>Fifty Shades Darker</em> movie soundtrack. However, the
<code>album_name</code> column for this song is <code>NA</code>, indicating that it does not appear
on one of Taylor's albums.
</p>
<p>Songs are only included one time. For example, if a song appears on both the
standard and deluxe version of an album, there is only one record of the
song in the data set. Similarly, compilations are not included. For example,
following the release of <em>folklore</em>, Taylor released several EPs that were
subsets of the original <em>folklore</em> album (e.g., <em>folklore: the escapism
chapter</em>, <em>folklore: the sleepless nights chapter</em>, etc.). These are not
included. Finally, all bonus tracks (with the exception of voice
memos or similar) are included; however, for consistency, the album name is
always the shortened, common name. For example, <em>the lakes</em> is a bonus track
from <em>folklore (deluxe edition)</em>, but the <code>album_name</code> is listed only as
<em>folklore</em>. The <code>bonus_track</code> variable can be used to determine which songs
appeared on the standard version of an album vs. a deluxe or platinum
edition.
</p>
<p><code>taylor_album_songs</code> contains the same information as <code>taylor_all_songs</code>, but
only for Taylor's official studio albums. Thus, <code>taylor_album_songs</code> is a
subset of <code>taylor_all_songs</code>, with EPs and individual singles excluded.
Critically, this subset also only includes versions owned by Taylor when
possible, because we stan artists owning their own work. This means that
although both <em>Fearless</em> and <em>Fearless (Taylor's Version)</em> appear in the full
<code>taylor_all_songs</code> data, only <em>Fearless (Taylor's Version)</em> appears in this
subset. This also means that this data set will change as additional
re-releases are made available (i.e., <em>Red</em> was replaced with
<em>Red (Taylor's Version)</em> in <a href="https://wjakethompson.com/blog/taylor/2021-12-17-taylor-1.0.0/">version 1.0.0</a>).
