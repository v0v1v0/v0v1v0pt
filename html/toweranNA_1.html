<h2>toweranNA: a Missing-Values Method Specific to Prediction
Applications</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A <em>nonimputational</em> method for handling missing values (MVs),
specifically for <em>prediction applications.</em>
</p>
<p><b>Norm Matloff (UC Davis) and Pete Mohanty (Google)</b>
</p>
<p>(This work was performed prior to PM's joining Google, and is not
connected to Google in any manner.)
</p>
<p><b>Overview: the Goal Is Prediction, Not Statistical
Inference</b>
</p>
<p>There are a number of powerful R packages for handling missing values
(MVs), such as <code>Amelia</code> and <code>mice</code>. They “fill in the
blanks” in MV-ridden datasets, so as to enable the user to do
statistical inference on the completed data.
</p>
<p>These methods are typically not capable of predicting new cases that have
MVs. With the <em>toweranNA</em> package, <em>the intended class of
applications is predictive modeling, rather than estimation.</em>
</p>
<p>Predictive methods of any type can be used with our Tower Method,
including both linear/generalized linear models and
nonparametric/machine learning methods.
</p>
<p><b>Usage</b>
</p>
<p>The function <em>makeTower</em> takes the data and regression model as
input, and creates an object of class ‘tower’. New cases can then be
predicted by calling <em>predict()</em> on that object.
</p>
<p>The call forms are:
</p>
<pre>

makeTower(data, yName, regFtnName, opts = NULL, scaling = NULL,
    yesYVal = NULL)
predict(towerObj, newx, k = 1)

</pre>
<p>The main arguments are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><em>data</em>: The training set, a data frame or equivalent.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>yName</em>: Name of the column containing “Y”, the variable to
be predicted.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>regFtnName</code>: Name of the regression model, currently ‘lm’,
‘glm’ or ‘towerKNN’.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>opts</code>: Optional arguments for <code>regFtnName</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>towerObj</code>: Object of class “tower” returned by
<code>makeTower()</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>newx</code>: The X data to be predicted (one or more new cases).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>k</code>, The number of nearest neighbors use in prediction. (Not the
same as <code>kmax</code> in <code>towerKNN</code>.)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The argument <em>k</em> is a tuning parameter chosen by the analyst.
</p>
<p><b>Example: Vocabulary Acquisition</b>
</p>
<p>This data is from the <a href="http://wordbank.stanford.edu">Stanford
University Wordbank project</a>. The data, <em>english</em>, is included in
the toweranNA package. Of the non-administrative variables,
e.g. excluding ‘Language’, which is always English in this data, about
43 percent of the values are missing.
</p>
<p>To illustrate how fitting and prediction occur, let's apply Tower to fit
the data and predict Y for the cases having missing values. We will take
age and gender as predictors.

<p><b>toweranNA: A Method Based on Regression
Averaging</b>
</p>
<p><em>Setting:</em> We have a dataset in which one of the columns, Y, is to
be predicted in the future. The remaining columns, collectively referred
to as X, are the predictor variables/features. Y can be either numeric
or an R factor.
</p>
<p>Most of the MV literature concerns estimation of some relationship, say
comparison of means, analysis of linear regression coefficients and the
like. One applies some MV method to the original data, obtaining a
“filled-in” version of the data (or several such versions). One then
performs one's statistical analysis on the new version.
</p>
<p>By constrast, our emphasis here is on <em>PREDICTION</em>, especially
relevant in our AI era. The main contribution of this package is a
technique that we call the Tower Method, which is <em>directly aimed
at prediction</em>. It is nonimputational, i.e. we do not make guesses as to
the missing values in X.
</p>
<p>Note carefully:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In describing our methods as being for regression applications,
<em>we do NOT mean imputing missing values through some regression
technique</em>; again, our technique is non-imputational. Instead, our
context is that of regression applications themselves, with the goal
being direct prediction of Y.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The term <em>regression function</em> does not necessarily imply a
linear model. It could also be, say, a logistic model, random forests,
etc.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Illustration via the vocabulary data example</em>
</p>
<p>Consider the above illustration, in which we wish to predict a new
case in which gender and mother's educational level are missed. Then
our prediction might be the estimated value of the regression function
of wage on age, birth order and ethnicity, i.e. the <em>marginal
regression function</em> of wage on that set of variables.
</p>
<p>Since each new case to be predicted will likely have a different pattern
of which variables are missing, we would need to estimate many
(potentially 32) marginal regression functions. For datasets with p
predictors, 2 to the power p of these would be needed.  This would in
many applications be computationally infeasible, as each marginal model
would need to be fitted and run through diagnostic plots, hyperparameter
investigation, and the like.
</p>
<p><em>But the Tower Property provides an alternative.</em> It tells us
that <em>we can obtain all the marginal regression functions from the
full one.</em>
</p>
<p><b>The Tower Property</b>
</p>
<p>There is a theorem in abstract probability theory that says for random
variables Y, U and V,
</p>
<pre>
   E[ E(Y|U,V) | U ] = E(Y | U) 
</pre>
<p>Though abstract, it is intuitive. Say Y, U and V are Wage, Gender and
Occupation. E(Y | U,V)) is the mean wage among all workers of a
given gender, in a given occupation. If we average that quantity over
men and women, but still keep occupation fixed, we obtain the mean wage
in that occupation.
</p>
<p>In terms of regression functions, this says that if we take the
regression function of Y on U and V, and average it over V for fixed U,
we get the regression function of Y on U. If V is missing but U is
known, this is very useful, as we will now explain.
</p>
<p><em>How it solves our problem</em>
</p>
<p>In our vocabulary example above, for a new case in which age, birth
order and ethnicity are known but for whom gender and mother's education
are missing, we would have
</p>
<p>U  = (age, birth order, ethnicity)
V = (gender,mom_ed)
</p>
<p>E(Y|U) is the target marginal regression function that we wish
to estimate and then use to predict the new case in hand. The Tower
Property implies that we can obtain that estimate by the averaging
process described above.
</p>
<p>Specifically, we fit the full model to the complete cases in the data,
then average that model over all data points whose values for which the
values of age, birth order and ethnicity match those in the new case to
be predicted. <em>Thus only the full model need be estimated, rather
than 2 to the power p models.</em>
</p>
<p>Our package <em>toweranNA</em> (“tower analysis with NAs”) takes this
approach. Usually, there may not be many data points having the exact
value specified for U, if any, so we average over a neighborhood of
points near that value. The argument <em>k</em> specifies the number of
near neighbors. Since we are averaging fitted regression estimates,
which are by definition already smoothed, a small value of <em>k</em>
should work well.
</p>
<p>Moreover, an early <em>Biometrika</em> paper by one of us (summarized in
(Matloff, 2017, Sec. 7.5)) proved that regression averaging improves
estimation of means, even with no MVs, thus an added bonus.
</p>
<p><b>Classification Applications</b>
</p>
<p>Say we wish to predict whether the child has a vocabulary of more than
100 words. Dichotomous Y in the package must be an R factor, with the
argument <em>yesYVal</em> specifying which level of the factor we wish
to be considered the positive case.

</pre>
<p><b>Application to Time Series</b>
</p>
<p>One can handle missing values in a time series, by converting to a data
frame, then applyng Tower.
</p>
<p><em>Example: Gold time series</em>
</p>
<p>Rob Hyndman's <em>forecast</em> package includes a time series
<em>gold</em>, consisting of 1108 daily gold prices. The series does
have some NAs, including two in the final 10 data points:
</p>
<pre>
data(gold,package='forecast')
gold[1099:1108]
# [1] 395.30 394.10 393.40 396.00     NA     NA 391.25 383.30 384.00 382.30
</pre>
<p>Let's predict the 1109th data point:
</p>
<pre>
towerTS(gold,5,1)  # lag 5, k = 1, 'lm' etc.
# 385.2088
</pre>
<p>Internallly, the function <em>regtools::TStoX()</em> transforms the data
to an 6-column matrix, designed for analysis of lag 5. Column 6 then
becomes Y, with columns 1:5 being X. So, the call to <em>lm()</em> is
loosely autoregressive, with each time point predicted from the previous
5.
</p>
<p><b>Could Other MV Packages Do
Prediction?</b>
</p>
<p>Could a <em>predict()</em> method be added to packages like
<code>Amelia</code> and <code>mice</code>?
</p>
<p>The answer on one level is no. The multiple imputation (MI) algorithms
they use are designed solely to “fill in the blanks” in the training
data. There is nothing in the algorithms on dealing with MVs in new
cases.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, some remedies are possible:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Each time we are presented with a new case having MVs, we could add it
to the original training data, with Y also treated as an MV. We could
then rerun the MI algorithm, and the filled-in spot for the new Y
would be our predicted value. (With multiple imputations, we could,
say, take the mean of the filled-in Ys. Of course, this would have the
drawback of entailing large increases in computation.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each time we are presented with a new case having MVs, we could find
the nearest filled-in row in the training set, and take its Y value as
our prediction for the new case. (Or look at k near neighbors and
average their Ys.) As we do here with Tower, distances would be
calculated on the basis of the intact values in the new case.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus <code>Amelia</code>, <code>mice</code> etc. could be “Tower-ized”. They
would not have the central focus on Y that Tower has, but reasonable
<em>predict()</em> methods could be developed for them via
Tower-ization.
</p>
<p>Intuition might suggest that such an approach may be less accurate in
predicting Y, as the MI algorithms are in essence devoting the data
resources to predicting all columns simultaneously. This would make an
interesting avenue for research, and we will be adding Tower-ization 
methods for <code>Amelia</code> etc.
</p>
<p>Also, what about regression functions and packages that do focus on
predicting Y and do allow missing X values in the training data?
Random forests packages such as <em>randomForest</em> and <em>grf</em>
come to mind. But again, these tolerate MVs at the training stage but
not in new cases.
</p>
<p><b>Assumptions</b>
</p>
<p>Compared to most MV packages, <em>toweranNA</em> has far less
restrictive assumptions. E.g. <code>Amelia</code> assumes multivariate
normality of the X vector, an assumption not even approximately met when
some components of X are categorical variables. The <code>mice</code>
package has extensive features for handling such cases, but there are
still attendant assumptions involved.
</p>
<p>Both of those packages, and most others, make the standard Missing at
Random (MAR) assumption. What about Tower?
</p>
<p>In our Tower Method, the assumption involves Y:
</p>
<p>E(Y | U, V &lt;- NA) = E(Y | U)
</p>
<p>where VNA is a boolean variable symbolizing that the variables in V are
missing.
</p>
<p>This assumption is neither implies nor is implied by MAR, but it is
similar to that condition. As with MAR, this assumption is not
verifiable, but in prediction applicants, the assumption are not so
vital.  We simply ask, “Does it work?”, meaning how
well does it predict new cases? And <em>that</em> is verifiable, via
cross-validation.
