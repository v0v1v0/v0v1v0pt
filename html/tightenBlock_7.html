<h2>
Initialize a Distance Matrix.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Creates an distance matrix of zeros of dimensions compatible with the treatment indicator vector z.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">startcost(z)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>z</code></td>
<td>

<p>A vector with z[i]=1 if individual i is treated or z[i]=0 if individual i is control.  The rows of costmatrix refer to treated individuals and the columns refer to controls.  Although not strictly required, it is best that z has names that are the same as the names of the data frame dat that will be used in matching.
</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A matrix of zeros with sum(z) rows and sum(1-z) columns.  If z has names, then they become the row and column names of this matrix.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Although names are not required, they aid clarity.  The cost matrix
# has sum(z) rows and sum(1-z) columns, where z is a binary vector.
# If needed, it is easier to connect an entry in z to a row or column in
# cost if they have the same name.  If z has names, the data matrix should
# have the same names.
