<h2>Regression coefficients from linear model as representation</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>repr_lm</code> computes seasonal regression coefficients from a linear model.
Additional exogenous variables can be also added.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">repr_lm(x, freq = NULL, method = "lm", xreg = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>the numeric vector (time series)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>freq</code></td>
<td>
<p>the frequency of the time series. Can be vector of two frequencies (seasonalities) or just an integer of one frequency.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>the linear regression method to use. It can be "lm", "rlm" or "l1".</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This model-based representation method extracts regression coefficients from a linear model.
The extraction of seasonal regression coefficients is automatic.
The maximum number of seasonalities is 2 so it is possible to compute representation for double-seasonal time series.
The first set seasonality (frequency) is main, so for example if we have hourly time series (<code>freq = c(24, 24*7)</code>),
the number of extracted daily seasonal coefficients is 24 and the number of
weekly seasonal coefficients is 7, because the length of second seasonality representation is always freq_1 / freq_2.
There is also possibility to add another independent variables (<code>xreg</code>).
</p>
<p>You have three possibilities for selection of a linear model method.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> "lm" is classical OLS regression.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "rlm" is robust linear model using psi huber function and is implemented in MASS package.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "l1" is L1 quantile regression model (also robust linear regression method) implemented in package quantreg.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>the numeric vector of regression coefficients
