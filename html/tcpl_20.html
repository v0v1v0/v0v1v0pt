<h2>List of level 2 multiple-concentration correction functions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>mc2_mthds</code> returns a list of correction/transformation functions 
to be used during level 2 multiple-concentration processing.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">mc2_mthds()
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The functions contained in the list returned by <code>mc2_mthds</code> return
a list of expressions to be executed in the <code>mc2</code> (not exported) 
function environment. The functions are described here for reference 
purposes, The <code>mc2_mthds</code> function is not exported, nor is it 
intended for use.
</p>
<p>All available methods are described in the Available Methods section, listed
by the function/method name.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list functions
</p>


<h3>Available Methods</h3>

<p>More information about the level 2 multiple-concentration processing is 
available in the package vignette, "Data_processing."
</p>


<h4>Correction Methods</h4>


<dl>
<dt>log2</dt>
<dd>
<p>Transform the corrected response value (cval) to log-scale (base 2).</p>
</dd>
<dt>log10</dt>
<dd>
<p>Transform the corrected response value (cval) to log-scale (base 10).</p>
</dd>
<dt>rmneg</dt>
<dd>
<p>Exclude wells with negative corrected response values (cval) and downgrading 
their well quality (wllq); if <code class="reqn">cval&lt;0, wllq=0</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>rmzero</dt>
<dd>
<p>Exclude wells with corrected response values (cval) equal to zero and 
downgrading their well quality (wllq); if  <code class="reqn">cval=0, wllq=0</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>mult25</dt>
<dd>
<p>Multiply corrected response value (cval) by 25; <code class="reqn">25*cval</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>mult100</dt>
<dd>
<p>Multiply corrected response value (cval) by 100; <code class="reqn">100*cval</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>negshift</dt>
<dd>
<p>Shift corrected response values (cval) by subtracting the minimum cval and 
adding 1, such that the new minimum is 1; <code class="reqn">cval-min+1</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>mult2.5</dt>
<dd>
<p>Multiply corrected response value (cval) by 2.5; <code class="reqn">2.5*cval</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>mult3</dt>
<dd>
<p>Multiply corrected response value (cval) by 3; <code class="reqn">3*cval</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>mult6</dt>
<dd>
<p>Multiply corrected response value (cval) by 6; <code class="reqn">6*cval</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>sub100</dt>
<dd>
<p>Center data around zero by subtracting the corrected response value (cval) from 
100; <code class="reqn">100-cval</code>. Typically used if data was pre-normalized around 100 with responses 
decreasing to 0.</p>
</dd>
<dt>zscore.npwlls</dt>
<dd>
<p>Convert the corrected response value (cval) to an absolute Z-Score based 
on the neutral and positive control wells (wllts = n and p), by assay plate ID (apid)</p>
</dd>
<dt>sub1</dt>
<dd>
<p>Center data around zero by subtracting the corrected response value (cval) from 1; 
<code class="reqn">1-cval</code>. Typically used if data was pre-normalized around 1 with responses decreasing to 0.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Aggregation Methods</h4>


<dl>
<dt>agg.mean.rep.apid</dt>
<dd>
<p>Aggregate technical test replicates (wllt=t) by taking the plate-wise mean per sample id (spid), assay plate (apid), and concentration index (cndx).</p>
</dd>
<dt>agg.median.rep.apid</dt>
<dd>
<p>Aggregate technical test replicates (wllt=t) by taking the plate-wise median per sample id (spid), assay plate (apid), and concentration index (cndx).</p>
</dd>
<dt>agg.percent.rep.spid</dt>
<dd>
<p>Use for binary data. Aggregate technical replicates as percentage by taking the sum of rval (raw values) relative to total replicates per sample id (spid) and concentration index (cndx); <code class="reqn">cval = (sum(rval)/.N)*100</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>agg.percent.rep.spid.min1</dt>
<dd>
<p>Use for binary data with variable number of replicates. Aggregate technical replicates as percentage by taking the sum of rval (raw values) relative to total replicates per per sample id (spid) and concentration index (cndx), where there is more than one replicate; <code class="reqn">cval=(sum(rval)/.N)*100,~where~.N&gt;1</code>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p> Rvals are collapsed to one value per cndx.
