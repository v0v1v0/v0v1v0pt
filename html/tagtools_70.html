<h2>Read a CSV file with sensor data from a CATS tag</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Read in data from a CATS tag deployment (stored in a .csv file). This function is usable by itself but is more normally
called by <code>read_cats</code> which handles metadata and creates a NetCDF file.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">read_cats_csv(fname, max_samps = Inf, skip_samps = 0)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fname</code></td>
<td>
<p>is the file name of the CATS CSV file including the complete
path name if the file is not in the current working directory or in a
directory on the path. The .csv suffix is optional.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>max_samps</code></td>
<td>
<p>is optional and is used to limit reading to a maximum number of samples (rows) per sensor. This is useful to read in a part of a very large file
for testing. If max_samps is not given, the entire file is read.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>skip_samps</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of lines of data to skip (excluding header) before starting to read in data. Defaults to 0 (start at the beginning of the file), but can be used to read in a part of a file, or to read in and process a large file in chunks.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A tibble data frame containing the data read from the file. The column names are
taken from the first line of the CSV file and include units and axis. Some columns may be empty (if for example, a tag did not record data from a certain sensor type).
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>CATS csv files can be extremely large; perhaps too large to read the entire file into memory at once and work with it.
