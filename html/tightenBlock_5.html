<h2>
Make a Match Using Two Criteria Matching with Optimal Subset Matching
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function makematch() is called by this package's main function, tighten(), as part of tightening an observational block design.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">makematch(dat, costL, costR, ncontrols = 1, controlcosts = NULL,
          treatedcosts=NULL, large=100, solver="rrelaxiv")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dat</code></td>
<td>

<p>A data frame.  Typically, this is the entire data set.  Part of it will be
returned as a matched sample with some added variables.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>costL</code></td>
<td>

<p>The distance matrix on the left side of the network, used for pairing.  This matrix would most often be made by adding distances to a zero distance matrix created by startcost(), for instance, using addMahal().  In Figure 1 of Zhang et al. (2023), these are the costs on the left treated-control edges.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>costR</code></td>
<td>

<p>The distance matrix on the right side of the network, used for balancing.  This matrix would most often be made by adding distances to a zero distance matrix created by startcost(), for instance, using addNearExact().  If you do not need a right distance matrix, then initialize it to zero using startcost() and do not add additional distances to its intial form.  In Figure 1 of Zhang et al. (2023), these are the costs on the right control-treated edges.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ncontrols</code></td>
<td>

<p>One positive integer, 1 for pair matching, 2 for matching two controls to each treated individual, etc.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>controlcosts</code></td>
<td>

<p>An optional vector of costs used to penalize the control-control edges.  For instance, one might penalize the use of controls with low propensity scores.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>treatedcosts</code></td>
<td>

<p>An optional vector of costs that penalize the treated-treated edges used for subset matching in Rosenbaum (2012,2024).  This option is available only if ncontrols=1.  If treatedcosts = NULL, then the cost is set to the largest element of costL, costR and controlcosts multiplied-by-large to prevent subset matching.  Otherwise, if treatedcosts is not NULL, then the ith coordinate of treatedcosts is the cost of not matching treated individual i.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>large</code></td>
<td>
<p>A large positive number.  Used only if treatedcosts = NULL.  See treatedcosts.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>solver</code></td>
<td>
<p>Determines the network optimization code that is used.  Options are solver="rrelaxiv" and solver="rlemon".  The Relax IV code of Bertsekas and Tseng (1988) is suggested, with solver="rrelaxiv", but is has an academic license, so various issues may arise.  The makematch() function calls the callrelax() function in
Pimentel's rcbalance package, whose documentation provides additional details, if needed.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Implements the two-criteria matching method of Zhang et al (2022)
with the possible addition of edges that permit some treated individuals to be removed rather than matched (Rosenbaum 2012).  It is helpful to look at Figure 1 in Zhang et al. (2023) before using this function and Figure 4 in Rosenbaum (2024).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a matched data set.  The matched rows of dat are returned with a new variable mset indicating the matched set.  The returned file is sorted by mset and z.
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

# This is a simple example to illustrate makematch().
# Please see the better match in the documentation for
# tighten() before continuing with this example.

###########
# Tighten match from 1-3 to 1-2 to adjust for BMI.
# BMI might be affected by alcohol consumption, so
# the primary comparison did not adjust for it.

# The example below illustrates mechanics.
# See the same example in tighten() for a
# simpler construction of a better match.

# If you need to debug, it is helpful to have the same names for z
# and rownames for dat.
# These names are then used by functions that create distance matrices,
# including startcost(), addNearExact() and addMahal().
# If you use names, they will be checked for consistency and an error
# may result from incompatible names.
