<h2>Get extra blocks in a Thurstonian design, that links as few blocks as possible.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function creates extra blocks in a Thurstonian design, that links as few
initial blocks as possible, with the number of blocks determined by
'count.xblocks'. This is only useful for comparisons between linked and
partially linked block designs (Jansen &amp; Schulze, 2023).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">get.xblocks.any(blocks, itf, multidim)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>blocks</code></td>
<td>
<p>A matrix defining the blocks of the model. The number of rows
must be the number of blocks, each row represents a block and contains the
item numbers. The number of columns present the number of items per block.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>itf</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector defining the items-to-factor relation. For example
'c(1,1,1,2,2,2)' defines six items, the first three correspond to factor 1,
the second three correspond to factor 2.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>multidim</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical. Should the items within each linking block be
forced to be multidimensional?</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The main strategy of the function is to create extra blocks that
link as few blocks as possible, with the number of blocks determined by
'count.xblocks'. Therefore, first all combinations of additional blocks with
the first two blocks are created. If more extra blocks are needed the
function uses block three, four, etc..
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The result is a matrix where the rows correspond to the specific
extra blocks.
