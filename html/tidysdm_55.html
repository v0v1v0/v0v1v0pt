<h2>Deprecated: Filter to retain only variables below a given correlation threshold</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. USE <code>filter_collinear</code> with <code>method=cor_caret</code> instead
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">filter_high_cor(x, cutoff = 0.7, verbose = FALSE, names = TRUE, to_keep = NULL)

## Default S3 method:
filter_high_cor(x, cutoff = 0.7, verbose = FALSE, names = TRUE, to_keep = NULL)

## S3 method for class 'SpatRaster'
filter_high_cor(x, cutoff = 0.7, verbose = FALSE, names = TRUE, to_keep = NULL)

## S3 method for class 'data.frame'
filter_high_cor(x, cutoff = 0.7, verbose = FALSE, names = TRUE, to_keep = NULL)

## S3 method for class 'matrix'
filter_high_cor(x, cutoff = 0.7, verbose = FALSE, names = TRUE, to_keep = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A <code>terra::SpatRaster</code> object, a data.frame (with only numeric
variables), or a correlation matrix</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cutoff</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric value for the pair-wise absolute correlation cutoff</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>A boolean for printing the details</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>names</code></td>
<td>
<p>a logical; should the column names be returned <code>TRUE</code> or
the column index <code>FALSE</code>)?</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>to_keep</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of variable names that we want to force in the set
(note that the function will return an error if the correlation among any of
those variables is higher than the cutoff).</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This method finds a subset of variable such that all have a correlation
below a certain cutoff. There are methods for <code>terra::SpatRaster</code>,
<code>data.frame</code>, and to work directly on a correlation matrix that was
previously estimated. For <code>data.frame</code>, only numeric variables will be
considered.
The algorithm is based on <code>caret::findCorrelation</code>, using the <code>exact</code> option.
The absolute values of pair-wise correlations are considered. If two
variables have a high correlation, the function looks at the mean absolute
correlation of each variable and removes the variable with the largest mean
absolute correlation.
</p>
<p>There are several function in the package <code>subselect</code>
that can also be used to accomplish
the same goal but tend to retain more predictors.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A vector of names of columns that are below the correlation threshold
(when <code>names = TRUE</code>), otherwise a vector of indices. Note that the indices
are only for numeric variables (i.e. if factors are present, the indices do
not take them into account).
