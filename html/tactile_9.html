<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>This paper reports the results of 20 experiments in which mixes of two or
three feldspars were reacted to produce coexisting plagioclase feldspar (PF)
and alkali feldspar (AF). Starting materials with similar bulk compositions
were prepared using different combinations of two and three minerals, and
experiments were designed to produce similar AF and PF minerals in the
experimental products from different starting binary and ternary
compositions. The coexisting AF and PF compositions produced as products
define compositional fields that are elongate parallel to the ternary solvus.
In 11 experiments reaction was sufficient to product fields of coexisting AF
and PF, or AF, PF, and melt with a bulk composition close to that of the
starting mixture. In six experiments significant reaction occurred in the
form of reaction rim overgrowths on seeds of the starting materials. Three
experiments produced AF, PF, and melt from a natural granite starting
material. A two-feldspar thermometer is presented in which temperature is
constrained by equilibria among all three components - Albite, Orthoclase,
and Anorthite - in coexisting ternary feldspars.
