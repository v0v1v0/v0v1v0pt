<h2>Counts of an insect for the combinations of 4 treatments and 6 areas of a field</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Counts of numbers of an insect, <em>Leptinotarsa decemlineata</em> (the
Colorado potato beetle), each of which is the sum for two plots treated
alike, for all combinations of 4 treatments and 6 areas of the field chosen
to be relatively homogeneous.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>a 4 x 6 matrix, where the rows are treatments and the columns are areas of a field.</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>These data are used in Tukey (1977) Exhibit 1 of Ch 11 and throughout the chapter as examples of
median polish. Because the data are counts, either a sqrt or log transformation would be
reasonable.
