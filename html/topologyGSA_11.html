<h2>Gene expression signatures in acute lymphocytic leukemia for BCR signaling pathway</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Several distinct genetic mechanisms lead to acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) malignant transformations deriving
from distinct lymphoid precursor cells that have been committed to either T-lineage or B-lineage differentiation.
Chromosome translocations and molecular rearrangements are common events in B-lineage ALL and reflect distinct
mechanisms of transformation. The B cell Receptor (BCR/ABL) gene rearrangement occurs in about 25% of cases in
adult ALL, and much less frequently in pediatric ALL.
<code>y1</code> dataset contains gene expression signatures of BCR signaling pathway (composed by 35 gene products, n.columns = 35)
in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) cells associated with presence of BCR/ABL gene rearrangement (n. rows = 37).
Expression values are normalized according to <code>rma</code> and <code>quantile</code> normalization.
