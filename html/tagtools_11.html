<h2>Buffers a signal vector into matrix</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function is used to buffer a signal vector into a matrix of data frames. If the input for nodelay is TRUE, the the signal is buffered with no delay. If nodelay is FALSE, and specifies a vector of samples to precede x[1] in an overlapping buffer.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">buffer(x, n, overlap, opt, nodelay = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>The signal vector to be buffered</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n</code></td>
<td>
<p>The desired length of data segments (rows).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>overlap</code></td>
<td>
<p>The desired amount of overlap between consecutive frames (columns) in the output matrix</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>opt</code></td>
<td>
<p>The vector of samples specified to precede x[1] in an overlapping buffer</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nodelay</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical statement to determine if the vector should be buffered with or without delay. Default is FALSE (with delay)</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list with 3 elements is returned if nodelay = FALSE:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>X: </strong> A matrix of the buffered signal vector "vec" with "n" data segments and an overlap between consecutive frames specified by "p". The matrix starts with "opt" values if nodelay is FALSE.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>z: </strong>  The remainder of the vector which was not included in the matrix if the last column did not have a full number of rows.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>opt: </strong> The last values, length of "p", of the matrix "X".
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If nodelay = TRUE, then a matrix of the buffered signal vector "vec" with "n" data segments and an overlap between consecutive frames specified by "overlap". The matrix starts with "opt" values if nodelay is FALSE.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">x &lt;- c(1:10)
n &lt;- 3
overlap &lt;- 2
opt &lt;- c(2, 1)
list1 &lt;- buffer(x, n, overlap, opt)
list2 &lt;- buffer(x, n, overlap, nodelay = TRUE)
</code></pre>
