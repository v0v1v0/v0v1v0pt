<h2>Holidays</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Functions that know about Federal and FRB (Federal Reserve
Board) holidays.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">nextBusinessDay(x, holidays = NULL, goodFriday = F, board = F, inaug = board)
previousBusinessDay(x, holidays = NULL, goodFriday = F, board = F, inaug = board)
isHoliday(x, goodFriday = F, board = F, inaug = board, businessOnly = T)
isBusinessDay(x, ...)
isGoodFriday(x)
isEaster(x)
holidays(years, goodFriday = F, board = F, inaug = board, businessOnly = T)
federalHolidays(years, board = F, businessOnly = T)
goodFriday(years)
easter(years)
inaugurationDay(years)
holidaysBetween(startTi, endTi, goodFriday = F, board = F, inaug = board,
                businessOnly = T)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>a <code>ti</code> time index, or something that can be turned into
one, such as a yyyymmdd number or a <code>Date</code> object.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>holidays</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector of holidays (in yyyymmdd form) to skip over, or
<code>NULL</code>. In the latter case, the <code>holidays</code> function is used
to determine days to skip over. </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>goodFriday</code></td>
<td>
<p>if <code>TRUE</code>, consider Good Friday as a holiday.
Default is <code>FALSE</code> because Good Friday is not a federal holiday.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>board</code></td>
<td>
<p>if <code>TRUE</code>, the Friday preceding a Saturday NewYears,
Independence, Veterans or Christmas Day is considered a holiday.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>inaug</code></td>
<td>
<p>if <code>TRUE</code>, consider the U.S. Presidential
Inauguration Day to be a holiday, but only if it falls on a weekday.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>businessOnly</code></td>
<td>
<p>if <code>TRUE</code> (the default), ignore Saturday NewYears,
Independence, Veterans amd Christmas Day holidays.  Has no effect if
<code>board</code> is <code>TRUE</code>, since that moves Saturday holidays to Friday.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>arguments passed on to <code>isHoliday</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>years</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric vector of 4 digit years</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>startTi</code></td>
<td>
<p>a daily <code>ti</code> time index, or something that can be
turned into one</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>endTi</code></td>
<td>
<p>a daily <code>ti</code> time index, or something that can be
turned into one</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Federal law defines 10 holidays. Four of them, NewYears, Independence,
Veterans and Christmas, fall on the same date every year. The other
six fall on particular days of the week and months (MLK, Presidents,
Memorial, Labor, Columbus, and Thanksgiving).
</p>
<p>If one of the four fixed-date holidays falls on a Sunday, the federal
holiday is celebrated the next day (Monday).  If it falls on a
Saturday, the preceding day (Friday) is a holiday for the Federal
Reserve Board, but not for the Reserve Banks and the banking system as
a whole.
</p>
<p>Presidential Inauguration day is a Federal holiday only in the DC
area, and then only if it falls on a weekday, so it is not included in
the holidays returned by <code>federalHolidays</code>, but it can be
included in several of the other functions by setting the <code>inaug</code>
argument to <code>TRUE</code>.
</p>
<p>The function <code>isBusinessDay</code> returns <code>TRUE</code> for <code>x</code> if
and only if <code>x</code> is not a holiday, a Saturday or a Sunday.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>nextBusinessDay</code> and <code>previousBusinessDay</code> return
"business" frequency <code>ti</code> objects.
</p>
<p><code>isHoliday</code>, <code>isGoodFriday</code>, <code>isEaster</code> and <code>isBusinessDay</code> return
Boolean vectors as long as <code>x</code>. 
</p>
<p><code>easter</code> and <code>goodFriday</code> return numeric vectors of yyyymmdd
dates of the appropiate holidays for each year in the <code>years</code>
argument.
</p>
<p><code>inaugurationDay</code> returns a numeric vector of yyyymmdd dates of
U.S. Presidential Inauguration Days, if any, that fall in the years
given in the <code>years</code> argument.  
</p>
<p><code>federalHolidays</code> returns a numeric vector of yyyymmdd dates
for the federal holidays for each year in <code>years</code>.  The
<code>names</code> attribute of the returned vector contains the holiday
names.
</p>
<p><code>holidays</code> returns a vector like <code>federalHolidays</code> does.
The only difference between the two functions is that <code>holidays</code>
has the option of including Good Fridays.
</p>
<p><code>holidaysBetween</code> returns a vector of yyyymmdd dates for holidays
that fall within the time spanned by <code>[startTi, endTi]</code>.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p> The algorithm for finding Easter dates was found somewhere on the
web (I don't remember where) and is unbelievably complex.  It would
probably be simpler to just celebrate the home opener of the Cleveland
Indians instead.
