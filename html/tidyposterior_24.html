<h2>Example Data Sets</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Example Data Sets
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Several data sets are contained in the package
as examples. Each <em>simulates</em> an <code>rset</code> object but the <code>splits</code>
columns are not included to save space.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><code>precise_example</code> contains the results of the classification
analysis of a real data set using 10-fold CV. The holdout data
sets contained thousands of examples and have precise
performance estimates. Three models were fit to the original
data and several performance metrics are included.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>noisy_example</code> was also generated from a regression data
simulation. The original data set was small (50 samples) and
10-repeated of 10-fold CV were used with four models. There is
an excessive of variability in the results (probably more than
the resample-to-resample variability). The RMSE distributions
show fairly right-skewed distributions.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>concrete_example</code> contains the results of the regression case
study from the book <em>Applied Predictive Modeling</em>. The original
data set contained 745 samples in the training set. 10-repeats
of 10-fold CV was also used and 13 models were fit to the data.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ts_example</code> is from a data set where rolling-origin forecast
resampling was used. Each assessment set is the summary of 14
observations (i.e. 2 weeks). The analysis set consisted of a
base of about 5,500 samples plus the previous assessment sets.
Four regression models were applied to these data.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ex_object</code> objects were generated from the <code>two_class_dat</code> data in
the <code>modeldata</code> package. Basic 10-fold cross validation was used to evaluate
the models. The <code>posterior_samples</code> object is samples of the posterior
distribution of the model ROC values while <code>contrast_samples</code> are posterior
probabilities form the differences in ROC values.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
