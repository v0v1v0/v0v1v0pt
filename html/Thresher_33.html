<h2>Thresher and Reaper Simulated Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data set contains five related simulated data sets, along with
the Thresher and Reaper objects obtained by clustering the data sets
and removing outliers. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(savedSims)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>


<dl>
<dt><code>sigma</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>: A list of length five; each entry is a covariance matrix
used to simulate data.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>savedSims</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>: A list of length five; each entry is a
<code>SimThresher</code> object obtained by simulating data from
one of the covariance matrices and running the <code>Thresher</code>
algorithm.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>savedReap</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>: A list of length five; each entry is a
<code>Reaper</code> object obtained by applying the <code>Reaper</code>
function.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Source</h3>

<p>The simulated data sets were prepared by running the script
<code>Examples/makeSims.R</code> that is installed along with the
<code>Thresher</code> package. The five covariance matrices vary in the
number of correlated subgroups (one or two) and whether they include
both positively and negatively correlated variables, or just
positively correlated ones. Each data set also includes two
uncorrelated "noise" variables that should automatically be removed by
the Reper-Thresher algorithms.
