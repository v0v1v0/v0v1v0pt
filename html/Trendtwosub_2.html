<h2>List of functions
freq.less function</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function finds the sum of counts that the x-sample observations is greater than or less than the ones from the y-sample.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">freq.less(x, y)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x, y</code></td>
<td>
<p>x and y are numerical vectors of different subsamples. The length of the two vectors can vary.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>When there is a tie between any pair of observations, 0.5 is added to the count. Missing value is allowed. Missing value is only added to the calculation when it is compared with another missing value from the other subsample.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Two values are returned: less.count and more.count. The first one is the total count that the observations in x-sample is less than the ones from the y-sample, and the second output is the total count that the observations in x-sample is more than the ones from the y-sample. When there is a tie, 0.5 is added to the count, instead of 1 or 0.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">freq.less(x=c(1,2,4,9,0,0,NA),y=c(1,4,9,NA))
</code></pre>
