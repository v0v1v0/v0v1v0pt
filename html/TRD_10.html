Transmission Ratio Distortion
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Transmission Ratio Distortion (TRD) is a genetic phenomenon where two alleles from either parent are not transmitted to the offspring at the expected 1:1 ratio under Mendelian inheritance. Occurrence of TRD in general population can lead to spurious association signals for the study on case populations, including genotype relative risk (GRR)  and imprinting effect. Therefore, it is necessary to adjust for TRD in association studies when TRD is suspected to be present.
</p>
<p>This package has implemented the loglinear model [Weinberg et al. 1998], the adjusted loglinear model for non-sex-of-parent-specific TRD (NST) [Huang et al. 2014] and sex-of-parent-specific TRD (ST) [Huang et al. 2015]; Transmission Disequilibrium Test(TDT)[Spielman et al. 1993], and adjusted TDT [Labbe et al. 2013].
</p>
<p>A simulation function is included in the package, which generates a population of case- and control-trios, with parent-of-origin information for disease allele in heterozygous child (rtrios), based on penetrance, ratio of maternal to paternal-induced disease risk for a heterozygous child, transmission probability of minor allele for mother and father, and minor allele frequency. Population and sample sizes can be specified by user. The data can be used directly to fit loglinear model (ll) or to perform a TDT (tdt) with or without adjustment for TRD.  Count data for the 15/16 mother-father-child category can also be computed (strata.cnt).
</p>
<p>The loglinear model can take input as trios or count data with or without parent-of-origin information. Types of loglinear model which can be fitted include genotype relative risk, gene-dosage, dominant models, with (grri, gdi, domi) or without (grr, gd, dom) imprinting effect. Real dataset of same structure can also be used to fit all types of loglinear model. Other functions are available to calculate population information, such as genotype counts (gcount), minor allele frequency (find.maf), transmission probability of minor allele (find.t), and theoretical prevalence of disease (prev). Note that trios with missing data are discarded when fitting the loglinear models.
