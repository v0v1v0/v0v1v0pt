<h2>teda: An implementation of the Typicality and Eccentricity Data Analysis
Framework.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The package provides functions to calculate both the batch and recursive
typicality and eccentricity values of given observations.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>TEDA provides a non-parametric technique to determine how eccentric/typical
an observation is with respect to the other observations generated by the
same process.  Available as either a batch function working over a whole
dataset, or as a recursive one-time-pass function that needs the current
mean and variance values to be passed as arguments.
</p>
<p>Both batch and recursive methods return a datatype (tedab or tedar) which
provide print and summary generic function implementations.  The batch
object also provides a generic plot function.
</p>
<p>Further work will implement more of the analytical framework built up
around TEDA, such as clustering algorithms.
