<h2>Lookup-table for IDs of taxonomic ranks</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>data.frame of 46 rows, with 2 columns:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> rankid - a numeric rank id, consecutive
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> ranks - a comma separated vector of names that are considered
equal to one another within the row
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>We use this data.frame to do data sorting/filtering based on the ordering
of ranks.
</p>
<p>Please let us know if there is a rank that occurs from one of the data
sources <span class="pkg">taxize</span> that we don't have in <code>rank_ref</code> dataset.
</p>
<p>Let us know if you disagree with the ordering of ranks.
</p>
<p>Note that <code>rankid</code> 280 are essentially "genetic variants"; placed just above
'unspecified' to denote they're not without rank, but they're not
really taxonomic ranks either. As far as I know there's no way
to delineate among these "genetic variant" types.
