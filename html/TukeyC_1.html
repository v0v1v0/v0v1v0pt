Conventional Tukey Test
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package performs what is known as the Tukey HSD test in the conventional 
way. It also uses an algorithm which divides the set of all means in groups 
and assigns letters to the different groups, allowing for overlapping. This is 
done for simple experimental designs and schemes. The most usual designs are:
Completely Randomized Design (‘<span class="samp">⁠CRD⁠</span>’),
Randomized Complete Block Design (‘<span class="samp">⁠RCBD⁠</span>’) and 
Latin Squares Design (‘<span class="samp">⁠LSD⁠</span>’).
The most usual schemes are:
Factorial Experiment (‘<span class="samp">⁠FE⁠</span>’),
Split-Plot Experiment (‘<span class="samp">⁠SPE⁠</span>’) and
Split-Split-Plot Experiment (‘<span class="samp">⁠SPE⁠</span>’).
</p>
<p>The package can be used for both balanced or unbalanced (when possible), experiments.
</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> has some functions
(<code>TukeyHSD</code> provided by <code>stats</code>,
<code>glht</code> provided by <code>multcomp</code>,
<code>HSD.test</code> provided by <code>agricolae</code> and
<code>cld</code> provided by <code>multcomp</code>) which also performs
the Tukey test. The <code>TukeyHSD</code> returns intervals based on the range of the
sample means rather than the individual differences. Those intervals are based 
on Studentized range statistics and are, in essence, confidence intervals.
This approach has two advantages: the p-value is showed allowing the user to
flexibilize the inferencial decision and also make it possible to plot the 
result of the test. However, it has one disadvantage, since the final result is 
more difficult to understand and summarize. Others (<code>glht</code>, <code>cld</code>) 
are also useful but difficult to manage.
Additionally, most of users of other statistical softwares are very used with 
letters grouping the means of the factor tested, making unattractive or 
difficult to adapt to the current aproach of <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>.
</p>
<p>So, the main aim of this package is make available in <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> environment the
conventional aproach of Tukey test with a set of flexible funtions and
S3 methods.
