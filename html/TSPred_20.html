<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A univariate artificial time series presenting 5 non-consecutive blocks of
20 unknown points.

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 980 observations on the following 5 variables.
</p>

<dd>
<p>a numeric vector containing the
known points 3001-3980 of the CATS time series.</p>
</dd> <dt>V5</dt>

vector containing the known points 4001-4980 of the CATS time series.</p>
</dd> </dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The CATS Competition presented an artificial time series with 5,000 points,
among which 100 are unknown. The competition proposed that the competitors
predicted the 100 unknown values from the given time series, which are
grouped into five non-consecutive blocks of 20 successive values
(<code>CATS.cont</code>). The unknown points of the series are the
981-1000, 1981-2000, 2981-3000, 3981-4000 and 4981-5000. The performance
evaluation done by the CATS Competition was based on the MSEs computed on
the 100 unknown values (E1) and on the 80 first unknown values (E2). The E2
error was considered relevant because some of the proposed methods used
interpolation techniques, which cannot be applied in the case of the fifth
set of unknown points.
