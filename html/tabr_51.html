<h2>Check if chords are major or minor</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Check if chords are major or minor where possible.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">chord_is_major(notes)

chord_is_minor(notes)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>notes</code></td>
<td>
<p>character, a noteworthy string.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>These functions operate based only on ordered pitches.
They do not recognize what a human might interpret and name an inverted
chord with a root other than the lowest pitch.
This imposes limitations on the utility of these functions,
which scan the intervals for a minor or major third in a chord whose notes
are sorted by pitch.
</p>
<p>In several cases including single notes or no major or minor third interval
present, <code>NA</code> is returned.
<code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code> is only returned if such an interval is present.
If more than one is present, it is based on the lowest in pitch.
It prioritizes major/minor and minor/major adjacent intervals (recognizing a
common triad). If these do not occur adjacent, the lowest third is selected.
This is still imperfect, but a useful method. Second and higher unknown
chord inversions are problematic.
