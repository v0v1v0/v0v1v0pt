<h2>Returns a dictionary of CUDA memory allocator statistics for a given device.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The return value of this function is a dictionary of statistics, each of which
is a non-negative integer.

cuda_memory_summary(device = cuda_current_device())
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>device</code></td>
<td>
<p>Integer value of the CUDA device to return capabilities of.</p>
</td>

<h3>Core statistics</h3>


<ul>
<li>
<p> "allocated.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}": number of allocation requests received by the memory allocator.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "allocated_bytes.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}": amount of allocated memory.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "segment.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}": number of reserved segments from cudaMalloc().
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "reserved_bytes.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}": amount of reserved memory.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "active.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}": number of active memory blocks.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "active_bytes.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}": amount of active memory.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "inactive_split.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}": number of inactive, non-releasable memory blocks.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "inactive_split_bytes.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}": amount of inactive, non-releasable memory.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For these core statistics, values are broken down as follows.
</p>
<p>Pool type:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> all: combined statistics across all memory pools.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> large_pool: statistics for the large allocation pool (as of October 2019, for size &gt;= 1MB allocations).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> small_pool: statistics for the small allocation pool (as of October 2019, for size &lt; 1MB allocations).
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Metric type:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> current: current value of this metric.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> peak: maximum value of this metric.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> allocated: historical total increase in this metric.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> freed: historical total decrease in this metric.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Additional metrics</h3>


<ul>
<li>
<p> "num_alloc_retries": number of failed cudaMalloc calls that result in a cache flush and retry.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "num_ooms": number of out-of-memory errors thrown.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
