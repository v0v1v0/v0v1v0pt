<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>varname</code></td>

<p>The name stem of the effects variables. By default, this is the first variable passed in the formula. In case of latent constructs, however, it might be preferable to set a new name for the latent construct.</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>se</code></td>
<td>
<p>This defines how significance tests are computed in the multi-group case. Either "LashleyBond" (= recommended significancetest by Lashley &amp; Bond, 1997; default) or "SOREMO" (= between group significance test as implemented in SOREMO). In single groups, always the Lashley-Bond standard errors and significance tests are provided.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>minVar</code></td>
<td>
<p>Actor and partners effects are only calculated if the respective relative variance component is greater than minVar. Set minVar to NA if this cleaning should not be performed. For small groups, Kenny (1994) suggests a minimum relative variance of 10% for the interpretation of SRM effects. In any case, actor/ partner effects and correlations with these variables should not be interpreted if these components have negative variance estimates. minVar defaults to zero; with RR.style this default can be changed for all subsequent analyses.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Please note: detailed instructions on how to use the TripleR package are provided in the built in pdf document ‘How to use TripleR’. You can open this document either by on this link: <a href="../doc/TripleR.pdf">../doc/TripleR.pdf</a>, or you can browse all included vignettes by opening the index of the package documentation (scroll down to the very end of this page and click on ‘Index’; than click on ‘Overview of user guides and package vignettes’). These help files are only for quick references.
</p>
<p>The estimation of the parameters of the Social Relation Model (SRM) is based on formulae provided by Kenny (1994; p. 236-244). If multiple groups are provided, SRMs are computed within each single group. Variance components then are calculated as the weighted average across groups (weighted with N – 1). Please note that in case of largely varying group sizes a precision weighting based on  inverse-variance weights might be preferable but is not currently implemented in TripleR.
For tests of significance of a single group, Triple R computes standard errors by using formulae published by Bond and Lashley (1996) for the case of a univariate SRM analysis. The formulae for the standard errors of the bivariate SRM parameters were kindly provided to us by C.F. Bond in personal communication. If multiple groups are provided, by default the standard error is computed as the square root of the weighted mean of the squared group-specific standard errors, as recommended by Lashley and Bond (1997). For <code>se = “SOREMO”</code> a between-group t-test is employed to calculate the significance which was suggested by Kenny and La Voie (1984) and is used in the software SOREMO.
</p>
<p>The Bond-Lashley standard errors operate under the assumption that the only source of variance in the SRM parameter is sampling error, i.e. that variance estimates do not differ systematically between groups. Lashley and Kenny (1998) found that this assumption was basically true in 13 different round robin studies. Thus, we generally recommend using the Bond-Lashley standard errors (<code>se="LashleyBond"</code>), which are more powerful than the Kenny-La Voie standard errors (<code>se="SOREMO"</code>), see Lashley and Bond (1997) and Lashley and Kenny (1998). However, in case that you have reasons to assume that variances systematically vary across groups, the Kenny-La Voie standard errors (<code>se="SOREMO"</code>) might be preferable as they are likely more robust in the presence of group effects (Lashley &amp; Kenny, 1998).
</p>
<p>The formula to specify the round robin design has following notation:
<code>DV ~ perceiver.id * target.id | group.id</code> (group.id is only provided if multiple groups are present). If two variables are used to describe one latent construct, both are connected with a slash on the left hand side: <code>DV1a/DV1b ~ perceiver.id * target.id</code>. If two variables are used to describe two manifest constructs, both are connected with a <code>+</code> on the left hand side: <code>DV1+DV2 ~ perceiver.id * target.id</code>. A latent analysis of two constructs would be notated as following: <code>DV1a/DV1b + DV2a/DV2b ~ perceiver.id * target.id</code>.
</p>
<p>Data sets from the Mainz Freshman Study (see Back, Schmukle, &amp; Egloff, in press) are included (liking_a, liking_b, metaliking_a, metaliking_b, likingLong), as well as an additional data set containing missing values (multiGroup)
</p>
<p>The handling for missing data (<code>na.rm=TRUE</code>) is performed in three steps:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Rows and columns which have less then <code>minData</code> data points are removed from the matrix (i.e. both the ‘missing’ row or column and the corresponding column or row, even if they have data in them)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> For the calculation of actor and partner variances, actor-partner-covariances and the respective effects, missing values are imputed as the average of the respective row and col means. The calculation of relationship variances and covariances as well as relationship effects is also based on the imputed data set; however, single relationship effects which were missing in the original data set are set to missing again.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> In the case of multiple variables (i.e., latent or bivariate analyses), participants are excluded listwise to ensure that all analyses are based on the same data set.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Printed are both unstandardized and standardized SRM estimates with the corresponding standard errors and t-values for actor variance, partner variance, relationship variance, error variance, actor-partner covariance, and relationship covariance. In case of a bivariate analysis values are additionally provided for actor-actor covariance, partner-partner covariance, actor-partner covariance, partner-actor covariance, intrapersonal relationship covariance, and interpersonal relationship covariance.
</p>
<p>Reliabilities of actor, partner, and relationship effects (the latter only in the case of latent analyses) are printed according to Bonito &amp; Kenny (2010).
</p>
<p>The returned values depend on the kind of analyses that is performed:
</p>
<p>Univariate, single group:
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>effects</code></td>

<p>List of results of univariate of SRM analyses of both variables- specify variable in index: univariate[[1]] or univariate[[2]]. That means, each of the both <code>univariate</code> objects is a complete RR object for the univariate analyses, nested in the results objects. If you want to retrieve the effects for the first variable, you have to type <code>RR2$univariate[[1]]$effects</code>. If you want to retrieve the variance components, you have to type <code>RR2$univariate[[1]]$varComp</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>bivariate</code></td>
<td>
<p>Results of bivariate SRM analyses</p>
</td>

</table>
<p>In the multiple group case, following values are returned:
</p>
<table>

<td><code>univariate</code></td>
<td>
<p>The weighted average of univariate SRM results</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">

</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>group.var</code></td>
<td>

</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>If self ratings are present in the data set, the function also prints the correlation between self ratings and actor/partner effects. In case of multiple groups, these are corrected for group membership (partial correlations). These correlations with self-ratings can also directly be computed with the function <code>selfCor</code>. Partial correlations to external (non-SRM) variables can be computed with the function <code>parCor</code>
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>In case that a behavior was measured, the variances of an SRM analysis are labeled as actor variance, partner variance and relationship variance (default output labels). In case that a perception was measured, perceiver is printed instead of actor and target is printed instead of partner. You can set appropriate output labels by using the function <code>RR.style</code>.
These settings from RR.style, however, can be overwritten for each <code>print</code> call: :
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>print(RRobject, measure1="behavior")</code>: prints output for a univariate analysis of behavior data.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>print(RRobject, measure1="perception")</code>: prints output for a univariate analysis of perception data.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>print(RRobject, measure1="behavior", measure2="behavior")</code>: prints output for a bivariate analysis of behavior data.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>print(RRobject, measure1="perception", measure2="perception")</code>: prints output for a bivariate analysis of perception data.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>print(RRobject, measure1="behavior", measure2="perception")</code> or <br><code>print(RRobject, measure1="perception", measure2="behavior")</code>: prints output for a bivariate analysis of behavior and perception data.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>print(RRobject, measure1="perception", measure2="metaperception")</code>: is for the special case that a perception and a corresponding metaperception was measured. In this case, additionally the appropriate output labels for bivariate SRM analyses of other- and metaperceptions (reciprocities, assumed reciprocities, meta-accuracies; see Kenny, 1994) are presented.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>print(RRobject, digits=6)</code>: Provide the number of displayed digits.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can plot any RR object using <code>plot(RR)</code>. See <code>plot.RRuni</code> for possible parameters.
