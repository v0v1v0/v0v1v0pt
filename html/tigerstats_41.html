<h2>Knife or Gun?</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>What will make you yell louder: being killed with a knife or being killed
with a gun?  Results of an entirely imaginary experiment performed on very
strange volunteers.  Members of the Knife group are killed by a knife, and
members of the Gun group are killed by a gun. The volume of the screams of each
subject during slaying is recorded.  In order to ensure that the two groups
are similar with respect to how loud they can yell in the first place,
subjects are blocked by whether or not they have participated in
hog-hollering contests.  After blocking, subjects are randomly assigned to
groups.
