<h2>Species names from Species Plantarum</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These names have been compiled from
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_Plantarum"><em>Species Plantarum</em></a> by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> originally
published in 1753. It is the first work to consistently apply
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_nomenclature">binomial names</a>
and was the starting point for the naming of plants. The book lists every
species of plant known at the time, classified into
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus">genera</a>. The dataset provides a
useful reference point to see how taxonomic names have changed since their
inception. The names were transcribed by Robert W. Kiger.
