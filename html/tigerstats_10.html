<h2>Chi Square Resampler (One at a Time)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An app to illustrate use of the chi-square statistic to test
for a relationship between two categorical variables.  The P-value is computed
by resampling, and the resamples are done one at a time.  A histogram of resampled chi-square statistics is displayed
after each resample, and summary information is output to the
console.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">ChisqSimSlow(form,data,effects=c("random","fixed"))
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>form</code></td>
<td>
<p>a formula of the form ~x+y.  When using
fixed effects (see below for explanation), x should be the
variable that is considered the predictor variable.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame from which x and y are drawn.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>effects</code></td>
<td>
<p>When effects="fixed", the re-sampling is performed under
the condition that the row sums in the re-sampled two-way table (with x
for rows) are the same as the row sums in the two-way table based on the
original data.  When effects="random", then both row and column sums
in the re-sampled table may vary: only the sum of the counts is
constant.  (Note:  in the re-sampling procedure for chisq.test
in the stats package of R, both row and column sums are
required to equal the corresponding sums for the original data.)</p>
