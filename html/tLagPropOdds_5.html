<h2>Toy Dataset For Illustration</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These data are provided for the purposes of illustrating the use of
the software. Though the data were generated under a scenario similar
to a real-world COVID-19 therapeutics clinical trial, they should not be  
interpreted as representing true clinical trial data.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(tLagData)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>tLagData is a time-dependent data.frame containing the following 
information for 602 participants ascertained at day 90 of a fictitious
randomized clinical trial.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>id:</dt>
<dd>
<p>A unique participant identifier.</p>
</dd>
<dt>A:</dt>
<dd>
<p>The treatment received, where A={0,1}.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Cat:</dt>
<dd>
<p>The ordered outcome category. There are 6 categories 
ascertained at day 90.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>1:</dt>
<dd>
<p> at home and off oxygen, number of days &gt;= 77;</p>
</dd> 
<dt>2:</dt>
<dd>
<p> at home and off oxygen, number of days 49-76;</p>
</dd>
<dt>3:</dt>
<dd>
<p> at home and off oxygen, number of days 1-48;</p>
</dd>
<dt>4:</dt>
<dd>
<p> not hospitalized and either at home on oxygen or not home;</p>
</dd>
<dt>5:</dt>
<dd>
<p> hospitalized for medical care or in hospice care; and</p>
</dd>
<dt>6:</dt>
<dd>
<p> dead.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If participant is censored, Cat = NA.</p>
</dd>
<dt>U:</dt>
<dd>
<p>The time at which the outcome category was determined or
the censoring time. For Cat = 1-5, U is the interim analysis
time (90 days). For Cat = 6, U is the time of death.
For Cat = NA, U is the censoring time.</p>
</dd>
<dt>delta:</dt>
<dd>
<p>The event indicator (1 if U is the time at which the
outcome category was determined;
0 if censored).</p>
</dd>
<dt>x:</dt>
<dd>
<p>A continuous baseline covariate.</p>
</dd>
<dt>start:</dt>
<dd>
<p>The lower bound of the time interval to which the
given covariate values pertain.</p>
</dd>
<dt>stop:</dt>
<dd>
<p>The upper bound of the time interval to which the
given covariate values pertain.</p>
</dd>
<dt>hospStatus:</dt>
<dd>
<p>A time-dependent indicator of hospital status, where 1
indicates that the participant was not in the hospital
during interval (start, stop]; 0 otherwise.</p>
</dd>
<dt>daysOut:</dt>
<dd>
<p>The expected number of continuous days out of hospital
at the time of the interim analysis (90 days).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
