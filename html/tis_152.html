<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>xTi</code></td>
<td>
<p>a <code>ti</code> object or something that the <code>ti()</code>
function can turn into a <code>ti</code> object </p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>latest{whatever}</code> functions are the same as the
corresponding <code>current{whatever}</code> functions, except that they
return the most recent completed <code>ti</code> of the desired frequency.
A period is considered to be completed on it last day.  For example,
if today is Thursday, then <code>latestWedweek()</code> returns the week
that ended yesterday.  Yesterday it would have returned the same week,
but the day before that (Tuesday) it would have returned the
"wwednesday" <code>ti</code> for the week that had ended six days before.
</p>
<p><code>latestWeek</code> returns the weekly <code>ti</code> for the most recently
completed week as of <code>xTi</code>.  If the <code>xTi</code> is itself a
<code>ti</code>, the returned week is the most recently completed week as of
the last day of <code>xTi</code>.  (Note that the default weekly frequency
is "wmonday" (Monday-ending weeks), so <code>latestWeek</code> always
returns "wmonday" <code>ti</code>'s.)  See
<code>setDefaultFrequencies</code> to change this.
</p>
<p>All of the other <code>latest{SomeFreq}</code> functions work the same way,
returning the <code>ti</code>'s for the most recently completed SomeFreq as
of the last day of <code>xTi</code>. The <code>tif</code>'s (frequencies) for
<code>latestHalf</code> and <code>latestQ4</code> are "semiannual" and
"quarterly", respectively. 
</p>
<p><code>latestJanuary</code> returns the monthly <code>ti</code> for January of the
most recently completed January-ending year that the last day of its
argument falls into.  <code>latestFebruary</code> returns the monthly
<code>ti</code> for February of the most recently completed February-ending
year that the last day of its argument falls into, and so on. 
</p>
