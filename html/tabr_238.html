<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Noteworthy strings may contain notes, pitches and chords. Noteworthy strings
are equal if they sound the same.
This means that if one string contains Eb (<code>e_</code>) and the other contains
D# (<code>d#</code>) then the two strings may be equal, but they are not identical.
</p>
<p><code>pitch_is_equal()</code> and <code>pitch_is_identical()</code> perform these respective
tests of equivalence on both notes and chords.
These are the strictest functions in terms of equivalent sound because pitch
includes the octave number.
</p>
<p><code>note_is_equal()</code> and <code>note_is_identical()</code> are similar but include a default
argument <code>ignore_octave = TRUE</code>, focusing only on the notes and chords.
This allows an even more relaxed definition of equivalence. Setting this
argument to <code>FALSE</code> is the same as calling the <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠pitch_is_*⁠</code> variant.
</p>
<p>Chords can be checked the same as notes. Every timestep in the sequence is
checked pairwise between <code>note1</code> and <code>note2</code>.
</p>
<p>These functions will return <code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code> for every timestep
in a sequence.
If the two noteworthy strings do not contain the same number of notes at a
specific step, such as a single note compared to a chord, this yields a
<code>FALSE</code> value,
even in a case of an octave dyad with octave number ignored.
If the two sequences have unequal length <code>NA</code> is returned.
These are bare minimum requirements for equivalence. See examples.
</p>
<p><code>octave_is_equal()</code> and <code>octave_is_identical()</code> allow much weaker forms of
equivalence in that they ignore notes completely. These functions are only
concerned with comparing the octave numbers spanned by any pitches present at
each timestep. When checking for equality, <code>octave_is_equal()</code> only looks at
the octave number associated with the first note at each step, e.g., only the
root note of a chord. <code>octave_is_identical()</code> compares all octaves spanned at
a given timestep.
</p>
<p>It does not matter when comparing two chords that they may be comprised of a
different numbers of notes.
If the set of unique octaves spanned by one chord is identical to the set
spanned by the other, they are considered to have identical octave coverage.
For example, <code>a1b2c3</code> is identical to <code>d1e1f2g3</code>. To be equal, it
only matters that the two chords begin with <code>x1</code>, where <code>x</code> is any
note.
Alternatively, for <code>octave_is_identical()</code> only, setting
<code>single_octave = TRUE</code> additionally requires that all notes from both
chords being compared at a given timestep share a single octave.
