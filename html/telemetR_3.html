<h2>Create Potential Blanking Periods for Identifying Optimal Blanking Period</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Takes a dataframe with telemetry detection data and a list of potential
Blanking Period multipliers (n_val) and crosses them, duplicating the entire
dataframe by the length of n_val. Detections are grouped by individual,
site, and any supplied grouping variables. Then events are created by
collecting detections which occur within n_val*ping_rate from the next
detection. This function can be very slow depending on the size of the
dataframe.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">blanking_event(
  data,
  var_site,
  var_Id,
  var_datetime,
  var_groups = NULL,
  var_ping_rate,
  n_val,
  time_unit
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>the detection dataframe with columns for sites, tag IDs,
datetime, any grouping variables, and the expected ping rate.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>var_site</code></td>
<td>
<p>the column name, in quotes, which identifies unique residency
sites, these sites should be as distinct as possible, such that it is
infrequent that organisms can be detected at two sites at a given time.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>var_Id</code></td>
<td>
<p>the column name, in quotes, which identifies the individual
transmitter/tag/organism identifier.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>var_datetime</code></td>
<td>
<p>the column name, in quotes, which identifies the date and
time of the detection event. This column should already have been converted
to POSIXct format.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>var_groups</code></td>
<td>
<p>a single string or vector of strings of the columns which
should be used to group animals. Common groupings are species and cohorts.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>var_ping_rate</code></td>
<td>
<p>the column name, in quotes, which identifies the
temporal frequency at which the transmitter emits a detectable signal.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n_val</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector sequence of integers which can be multiplied by the
ping rate to construct multiple potential blanking periods. The range and
step values for n should be selected based on prior knowledge about general
behavior habits of the study organism and the functionality of the equipment.
For more information, please refer to Capello et. al. 2015.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>time_unit</code></td>
<td>
<p>the preferred unit of time to calculate durations, this
should correspond to the ping_rate, (i.e. if the ping rate is 3 seconds, the
preferred time_unit is seconds). If the preferred time_unit is on the same
scale as the ping_rate, the ping rate should be converted to the same scale.</p>

</tr>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A dataframe which has been crossed with all integers in n_val, and
which has been condensed into events. Please refer to Capello et. al. 2015
for further detail about the creation of these events.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Create a dataframe of events blanked by a set of n_values from 1:10
blanking_event(data = filtered_detections,
               var_Id = "Tag_Code",
               var_site = "receiver_general_location",
               var_datetime = "DateTime_Local",
               var_groups = "fish_type",
               var_ping_rate = "tag_pulse_rate_interval_nominal",
               n_val = c(1:2),
               time_unit = "secs")
