<h2>Labels and Perception of Quality</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Students in MAT 111 performed an experiment to see whether the perception of
the quality of peanut butter was affected by the labeling on the peanut
butter jar.  Each subject tasted from two jars, one of which was labeled
Jiff, and the other of which was labeled Great Value (a cheaper brand).
Unknown to the subjects, both jars contained Great Value peanut butter.
Each subject rated the quality of the peanut butter on a scale of 1 to 10.
