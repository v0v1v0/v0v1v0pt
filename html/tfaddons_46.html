<h2>Connected components</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Labels the connected components in a batch of images.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">img_connected_components(images, name = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>images</code></td>
<td>
<p>A 2D (H, W) or 3D (N, H, W) Tensor of image (integer,
floating point and boolean types are supported).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>name</code></td>
<td>
<p>The name of the op.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A component is a set of pixels in a single input image, which are
all adjacent and all have the same non-zero value. The components
using a squared connectivity of one (all equal entries are joined with
their neighbors above,below, left, and right). Components across all
images have consecutive ids 1 through n.
Components are labeled according to the first pixel of the
component appearing in row-major order (lexicographic order by
image_index_in_batch, row, col).
Zero entries all have an output id of 0.
This op is equivalent with 'scipy.ndimage.measurements.label'
on a 2D array with the default structuring element
(which is the connectivity used here).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Components with the same shape as 'images'. entries that evaluate to
FALSE (e.g. 0/0.0f, FALSE) in 'images' have value 0, and all other entries
map to a component id &gt; 0.
</p>


<h3>Raises</h3>

<p>TypeError: if 'images' is not 2D or 3D.
