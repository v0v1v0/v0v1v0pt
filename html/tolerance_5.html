<h2>Binomial Tolerance Intervals</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Provides 1-sided or 2-sided tolerance intervals for binomial random variables.  From a statistical quality control
perspective, these limits use the proportion of defective (or acceptable) items in a sample to bound the number
of defective (or acceptable) items in future productions of a specified quantity.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">bintol.int(x, n, m = NULL, alpha = 0.05, P = 0.99, side = 1, 
           method = c("LS", "WS", "AC", "JF", "CP", "AS", 
           "LO", "PR", "PO", "CL", "CC", "CWS"), 
           a1 = 0.5, a2 = 0.5)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of defective (or acceptable) units in the sample. Can be a vector of length <code>n</code>, in which case the sum of <code>x</code> is used.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n</code></td>
<td>
<p>The size of the random sample of units selected for inspection.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>m</code></td>
<td>
<p>The quantity produced in future groups. If <code>m = NULL</code>, then the tolerance limits will be constructed assuming <code>n</code> for this quantity.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>alpha</code></td>
<td>
<p>The level chosen such that <code>1-alpha</code> is the confidence level.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>P</code></td>
<td>
<p>The proportion of the defective (or acceptable) units in future samples of size <code>m</code> 
to be covered by this tolerance interval.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>side</code></td>
<td>
<p>Whether a 1-sided or 2-sided tolerance interval is required (determined by <code>side = 1</code> or <code>side = 2</code>,
respectively).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>The method for calculating the lower and upper confidence bounds, which are used in the calculation
of the tolerance bounds.  The default method is <code>"LS"</code>, which is the large-sample method.  <code>"WS"</code> is Wilson's method, which is just the score confidence interval.  <code>"AC"</code> gives the Agresti-Coull method,
which is also appropriate when the sample size is large.  <code>"JF"</code> is Jeffreys' method, which is a Bayesian approach
to the estimation.  <code>"CP"</code> is the Clopper-Pearson (exact) method, which is based on beta percentiles and provides a more conservative interval.  <code>"AS"</code> is
the arcsine method, which is appropriate when the sample proportion is not too close to 0 or 1.  <code>"LO"</code> is the logit
method, which also is appropriate when the sample proportion is not too close to 0 or 1, but yields a more conservative interval.  <code>"PR"</code> uses a probit transformation and is accurate for large sample sizes.  <code>"PO"</code> is based on a Poisson parameterization, but it tends to be more erratic compared to the other methods.  <code>"CL"</code> is the complementary log transformation and also tends to perform well for large sample sizes.  <code>"CC"</code> gives a continuity-corrected version of the large-sample method.  <code>"CWS"</code> gives a continuity-corrected version of Wilson's method.
More information on these methods can be found in the "References".</p>
