<h2>Toolmark profiles dataset</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data set of toolmarks (profiles) created by screwdrivers under different angles. 
Tool mark data included here were produced by Prof. Scott Chumbley, Mr. Stephen Davis, Ms. Taylor Grieve, Mr. Ryan Spotts, and Dr. Jeremy Hadler. These data were produced as part of research performed at the Ames Laboratory, located on the Iowa State University campus.
