<h3>Description</h3>

<p><span class="pkg">tigers</span> provides functions for manipulating polygons,
coordinates, ...
</p>
<p>All the tools programmed in <span class="pkg">tigers</span> are “class-free”: they work
on numeric vectors or matrices (even data frames) that store
coordinates. So the functions in the present package can easily be
interfaced with other packages such as <span class="pkg">terra</span>, <span class="pkg">sf</span>, or
<span class="pkg">sp</span>.
</p>
<p>The majority of the computations done by <span class="pkg">tigers</span> are performed by
efficient C code which could be interfaced with other languages (e.g.,
Python).
</p>
<p>The complete list of functions can be displayed with
<code>library(help = tigers)</code>.
