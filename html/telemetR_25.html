<h2>Residency Survival Plot</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Takes a dataframe of the proportion of events created by each potential
blanking period which "survived" a certain time (t) and creates a plot.
Used to visually look for convergences between survival lines.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">residence_plot(time_df, var_groups = NULL, time_unit)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>time_df</code></td>
<td>
<p>a dataframe created by duration compare showing the proportion
of events created by each potential blanking period which "survived" a
certain time (t)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>var_groups</code></td>
<td>
<p>a single string or vector of strings of the columns which
should be used to group organisms. Common groupings are species and cohorts.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>time_unit</code></td>
<td>
<p>the unit of time used to calculate durations</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A plot of the proportion of events created by each potential
blanking period at each time (t).
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">#Plot a comparison of the number of events longer than a given time `t`
residence_plot(time_df = time_test,
               var_groups = "fish_type",
               time_unit = "secs")
# Note: that the large number of lines extending past the largest Time
# indicates that a larger t is needed to ensure convergence
