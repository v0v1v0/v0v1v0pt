<h2>Example Completely Filtered Detection Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An example dataset of real acoustic telemetry detections of fish at several
receivers within the California Central Valley from 2021. These detections
have already been been processed using 'prefilter()' and 'add_org()'.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">filtered_detections
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>## 'filtered_detections'
A data frame with 41,000 rows and 26 columns:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>ReceiverSN</dt>
<dd>
<p>The serial number of the detecting receiver</p>
</dd>
<dt>DateTime_Local</dt>
<dd>
<p>the local time of the detection (tz = America/Los_Angeles)</p>
</dd>
<dt>Tag_Code</dt>
<dd>
<p>The hexadecimal acoustic tag ID code</p>
</dd>
<dt>CheckMBP</dt>
<dd>
<p>A calculated field from the prefilter checking the
time between acoustic transmissions from the same tag was &gt;0.3secs</p>
</dd>
<dt>TagInFile</dt>
<dd>
<p>A calculated field from the add_fish filter which
queries whether the tag code of the detection is associated with an
organism.</p>
</dd>
<dt>fish_type</dt>
<dd>
<p>Generally a strain, run, and species of fish (e.g.
Nimbus Fall Chinook = Fall-run Chinook Salmon from Nimbus Hatchery)</p>
</dd>
<dt>org_release_Date</dt>
<dd>
<p>The release date and time of the fish</p>
</dd>
<dt>release_location</dt>
<dd>
<p>The coded name of the release site</p>
</dd>
<dt>length</dt>
<dd>
<p>The length of the fish in millimeters</p>
</dd>
<dt>weight</dt>
<dd>
<p>The weight of the fish in grams</p>
</dd>
<dt>tag_weight</dt>
<dd>
<p>The weight of the implanted acoustic tag</p>
</dd>
<dt>tag_model</dt>
<dd>
<p>The model number of the implanted acoustic tag</p>
</dd>
<dt>tag_pulse_rate_interval_nominal</dt>
<dd>
<p>The pulse rate interval (time
between transmissions) of the implanted tag, as reported by the
manufacturer</p>
</dd>
<dt>tag_life</dt>
<dd>
<p>The expected number of days the tag should continue to
transmit, as reported by the manufacturer</p>
</dd>
<dt>CheckDT</dt>
<dd>
<p>A calculated field which checks whether the detection
occurred after the release of the fish</p>
</dd>
<dt>CheckBattLife</dt>
<dd>
<p>A calculated field which checks whether the detection
occurred before the tag battery is expected to expire (2x tag life)</p>
</dd>
<dt>dep_id</dt>
<dd>
<p>A unique id is created for each receiver deployment</p>
</dd>
<dt>Make</dt>
<dd>
<p>The brand of the acoustic receiver</p>
</dd>
<dt>latitude</dt>
<dd>
<p>The decimal degree latitude (WGS1984) of the acoustic
receiver at deployment</p>
</dd>
<dt>longitude</dt>
<dd>
<p>The decimal degree longitude (WGS1984) of the acoustic
receiver at deployment</p>
</dd>
<dt>receiver_location</dt>
<dd>
<p>The site name of an individual receiver, often
more than one 'receiver_location' is found at a 'receiver_general_location'</p>
</dd>
<dt>receiver_general_location</dt>
<dd>
<p>The more general geographic name of the
location of the receiver</p>
</dd>
<dt>receiver_river_km</dt>
<dd>
<p>The number of river kilometers the receiver is
from the Golden Gate Bridge</p>
</dd>
<dt>receiver_start</dt>
<dd>
<p>The start time of the reciever (generally when it
was deployed)</p>
</dd>
<dt>receiver_end</dt>
<dd>
<p>The end time of the receiver (generally when it was
retrieved)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
