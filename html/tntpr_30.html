<h2>Initialize a new repository, and a single subfolder, TNTP style.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Create a new repository on Bitbucket, then set your working
directory to that folder and run this function.  It will set up the main
repo folder as well as a single subfolder in which you can work on your
immediate project.
</p>
<p>You must specify the subfolder name as well as the long name associated with
that project and the analyst(s) working on it.  These latter two values are
used to create a README.Md file.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>
