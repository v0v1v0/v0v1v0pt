<h2>Complementary filtering of a signal.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function breaks signal X into two or more frequency bands such that the sum of the signals in the separate bands is equal to the original signal.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">comp_filt(X, sampling_rate = NULL, fc)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>X</code></td>
<td>
<p>A sensor vector or matrix (i.e., with a signal in each column) or sensor list (e.g., from readtag.R).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sampling_rate</code></td>
<td>
<p>The sampling rate of the sensor data in Hz (samples per second).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fc</code></td>
<td>
<p>Specifies the cut-off frequency or frequencies of the complementary filters. Frequencies are in Hz. If one frequency is given, X will be split into a low- and a high-frequency component. If fc contains more than one value, X will be split into multiple complementary bands. Each filter length is 4*sampling_rate/fc. Filtering adds no group delay.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Possible input combinations: comp_filt(X,sampling_rate,fc) if X is a vector or matrix, comp_filt(X,fc = fc) if X is a list
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list of filtered signals. There are n+1 sections of the list where n is the length of fc. List sections are ordered in Xf from lowest to highest frequency. Each list section contains a vector or matrix of the same size as X, and at the same sampling rate as X.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">Xf &lt;- comp_filt(X = beaked_whale$A$data, sampling_rate = beaked_whale$A$sampling_rate, fc = .15)
xf &lt;- list(Xf1 = Xf[[1]], Xf2 = Xf[[2]])
plott_base(xf, beaked_whale$A$sampling_rate)

</code></pre>
