<h2>List of level 4 multiple-concentration methods for calculating bmad</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>mc4_mthds</code> returns a list of methods to be used 
during level 4 multiple-concentration processing for calculating bmad
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">mc4_mthds()
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The functions contained in the list returned by <code>mc4_mthds</code> take 
<code>aeids</code> (a numeric vector of aeid values) and returns a list of expressions 
to be executed in the <code>mc4</code> (not exported) function environment. The 
functions are described here for reference purposes, The 
<code>mc4_mthds</code> function is not exported, nor is it intended for use.
</p>
<p>All available methods are described in the Available Methods section, listed
by the type of function and the function/method name.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list of functions
</p>


<h3>Available Methods</h3>

<p>Although it does not say so specifically in each description, all methods 
are applied by aeid.
</p>
<p>More information about the level 4 multiple-concentration processing is 
available in the package vignette, "Data_processing."

<dl>
<dt>bmad.aeid.lowconc.twells</dt>
<dd>
<p>Calculate the baseline median absolute value (bmad) as the 
median absolute deviation of normalized response values (rep) for test compound wells (wllt = t) 
with concentration index (cndx) equal to 1 or 2. Calculate one standard deviation of the normalized 
response for test compound wells (wllt = t) with a concentration index (cndx) of 1 or 2; 
onesd = sqrt(sum((resp - mean resp)^2)/sample size - 1). Onesd is used to establish BMR and therefore required for tcplfit2 processing.</p>
</dd>
<dt>bmad.aeid.lowconc.nwells</dt>
<dd>
<p>Calculate the baseline median absolute value (bmad) as the 
median absolute deviation of normalized response values (resp) for neutral control wells (wllt = n).
Calculate one standard deviation of the normalized response for neutral control wells (wllt = n);
onesd = sqrt(sum((resp - mean resp)^2)/sample size - 1). Onesd is used to establish BMR and therefore required for tcplfit2 processing.</p>
</dd>
<dt>bidirectional.false</dt>
<dd>
<p>Limits bidirectional fitting and processes data in positive 
analysis direction only. Use for gain-of-signal or inverted data.</p>
</dd>
<dt>bmad5.onesd16.static</dt>
<dd>
<p>Replace baseline median absolute deviation
(bmad) with 5 and one standard deviation (osd) of the normalized response
for test compound wells (wllt = t) with a concentration index (cndx) of 1
or 2 with 16. Typically used for binary data where values would otherwise
be 0; non-zero values are required for tcplfit2 processing.</p>
</dd>
<dt>no.unbounded.models</dt>
<dd>
<p>Exclude unbounded models and only fit data to bounded models (hill, gnls, exp4 and exp5).</p>
</dd>
