<h2>A 'shiny' Taylor-Russell demonstration program</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>


<p><code>TRDemo()</code> is an R 'shiny' function for illustrating the bivariate 
(i.e., single predictor) Taylor-Russell model for 
personnel selection. The function can be called 
from the command prompt (<code>&gt;</code>) by typing:
</p>
<p><code>TRDemo()</code>

</p>
<p>After calling the function, users are asked to enter values for 3 of the 
following 4 variables:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> The Base Rate (BR) of successful criterion performance 
(i.e., within the target population, the proportion of individuals who 
successfully execute the job demands). 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The Selection Ratio (SR; i.e., the proportion of hired candidates within 
the target population).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The Criterion Validity (CV; the correlation between the selection test 
and an operationalized measure of job performance).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The Positive Predicted Value (PPV; The probability that a hired 
individual can successfully execute the 
job demands).
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>TRDemo()</code> is a 'shiny' program for demonstrating the 
classic Taylor-Russell model for personnel selection.
</p>
<p><code>TRDemo()</code> calculates the model-implied value for the omitted 
variable and prints all model parameters (e.g., BR, SR, 
CV, and PPV) to 
screen. Given these parameters, the function also reports the test Sensitivity 
(defined as the probability that a qualified individual will be hired) and 
test Specificity (defined as the probability that an unqualified individual 
will not be hired). Finally, the function plots a 
correlation ellipse (associated with the CV) showing the relative 
proportions of True Positives (TP; hired individuals who are 
qualified for the job), False Positives (FP; hired individuals who are not 
qualified for the job), True Negatives (TN; non hired individuals who are 
not qualified for the job), and  
False Negatives (FN; non hired individuals who are qualified for the job).
