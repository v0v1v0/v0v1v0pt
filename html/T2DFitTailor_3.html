<h2>Tailor Exercise Plan for T2D Patients</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function generates a tailored exercise plan for T2D (Type 2 Diabetes)
</p>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>input_df</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame containing patient data necessary for
generating a tailored exercise plan. Each column in the dataframe should
be as follows (All data must be numeric.):
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Age</dt>
<dd>
<p>Patient's age in years.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Sex</dt>
<dd>
<p>Patient's sex, where 0 might denote female and 1 denotes male.</p>
</dd>
<dt>BMI</dt>
<dd>
<p>Body Mass Index, a measure of body fat based on height and weight.</p>
</dd>
<dt>WHtR</dt>
<dd>
<p>Patient's ratio of waist and height.</p>
</dd>
<dt>PCS</dt>
<dd>
<p>Patient's Physical Component Summary (PCS) score,
a metric derived from the SF-12 (Short Form Health Survey) which measures health-related quality of life.
The PCS score is calculated based on responses to questions in the SF-12 survey,
reflecting physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, and physical roles.
A higher score indicates better physical health. Users can refer to the <code>PCS_Calculation</code>
function within this package for detailed calculations based on SF-12 survey responses.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Duration_T2D (year)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Duration of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in years.
It reflects how long the patient has been living with Type 2 diabetes.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Total cholesterol (mmol/L)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Total cholesterol levels in mmol/L.
This measurement includes LDL, HDL, and other lipid components. Higher overall
cholesterol levels can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, although the
balance of different types of lipids (HDL, LDL, others) also plays a critical role.</p>
</dd>
<dt>HDL (mmol/L)</dt>
<dd>
<p>High-Density Lipoprotein cholesterol levels in mmol/L.
HDL is considered the "good" cholesterol, and higher levels are often associated
with a lower risk of heart disease.</p>
</dd>
<dt>LDL (mmol/L)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Low-Density Lipoprotein cholesterol levels in mmol/L.
LDL is often referred to as the "bad" cholesterol because high levels can lead to
plaque buildup in arteries and increase the risk of heart disease.</p>
</dd>
<dt>VO2_Max</dt>
<dd>
<p>Patient's maximum oxygen uptake.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Lung_capacity</dt>
<dd>
<p>Patient's lung volume or capacity.</p>
</dd>
<dt>BACK_Scratch_Test</dt>
<dd>
<p>Assessment of the patient's upper limb flexibility and shoulder range of motion.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note: It is crucial that the data for each of these columns is correctly formatted
and accurately represents the patient's health information for the exercise
plan to be effectively tailored.</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list containing two data frames: <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠$RecommendedExercisePlan⁠</code>: This data frame includes exercise plans that
are recommended based on the criterion that the intervention leads to a positive reduction in HbA1c levels,
and <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠$AllExercisePlan⁠</code> which includes all received plans.
</p>
