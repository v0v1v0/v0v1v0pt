<h2>Extract misaligned elements</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Extract misaligned elements from the Smith-Waterman alignment, namely
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>before_alignment: Sections in a or b which were occurring before the alignment
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>wrong_alignment: Sections in a or b which were mismatched in the alignment
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>after_alignment: Sections in a or b which were occurring after the alignment
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">smith_waterman_misaligned(x, type = c("a", "b"))
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object of class <code>smith_waterman</code> as returned by <code>smith_waterman</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p>either 'a' or 'b' indicating to return elements misaligned from <code>a</code> or from <code>b</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a list of character vectors of misaligned elements
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>before_alignment: Sections in a or b which were occurring before the alignment
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>wrong_alignment: Sections in a or b which were mismatched in the alignment
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>after_alignment: Sections in a or b which were occurring after the alignment
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>combined: The combination of <code>before_alignment</code>, <code>wrong_alignment</code> and <code>after_alignment</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>partial: Logical, where TRUE indicates that there is at least a partial alignment and FALSE indicating no alignment between <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> was done (alignment score of 0)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
