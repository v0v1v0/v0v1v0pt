<h2>
Generates a time-ordered network from an interaction list.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Constructs a directed network describing the causally permitted paths between a set of vertices that interact at known times.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">generatetonetwork(raw, allindivs)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>raw</code></td>
<td>

<p>An event list, consisting of a data frame with four columns: VertexFrom, VertexTo, TimeStart, and TimeStop. Each row in this data frame represents a single directed interaction event between VertexFrom and VertexTo beginning at TimeStart and ending at TimeStop.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>allindivs</code></td>
<td>

<p>A list of all possible vertices potentially including ones not observed interacting during the range of time reported in <code>raw</code>. Defaults to the vertices observed in raw.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A weighted directed network of class 'igraph'. Each vertex represents an individual at a time during which an interaction occurred. Edges represent causally permitted paths of resource flow and have a TimeCost, describing the time between interactions for an individual, or is 0 if the edge represents an interaction, and a HopCost, which is 0 if the edge connects the same individual at multiple times and 1 if it connects different individuals at the same time.
