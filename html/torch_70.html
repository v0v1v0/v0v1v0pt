<h2>Trace a function and return an executable <code>script_function</code>.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Using <code>jit_trace</code>, you can turn an existing R function into a TorchScript
<code>script_function</code>. You must provide example inputs, and we run the function,
recording the operations performed on all the tensors.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">jit_trace(func, ..., strict = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>func</code></td>
<td>
<p>An R function that will be run with <code>example_inputs</code>. func arguments
and return values must be tensors or (possibly nested) lists that contain tensors.
Can also be a <code>nn_module()</code>, in such case <code>jit_trace_module()</code> is used to trace
that module.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>example inputs that will be passed to the function while
tracing. The resulting trace can be run with inputs of different types and
shapes assuming the traced operations support those types and shapes.
<code>example_inputs</code> may also be a single Tensor in which case it is automatically
wrapped in a list. Note that <code>...</code> <strong>can not</strong> be named, and the order is
respected.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>strict</code></td>
<td>
<p>run the tracer in a strict mode or not (default: <code>TRUE</code>). Only
turn this off when you want the tracer to record your mutable container types
(currently list/dict) and you are sure that the container you are using in
your problem is a constant structure and does not get used as control flow
(<code>if</code>, <code>for</code>) conditions.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The resulting recording of a standalone function produces a <code>script_function</code>.
In the future we will also support tracing <code>nn_modules</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An <code>script_function</code> if <code>func</code> is a function and <code>script_module</code> if
<code>func</code> is a <code>nn_module()</code>.
</p>


<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>Tracing only correctly records functions and modules which are not data dependent
(e.g., do not have conditionals on data in tensors) and do not have any untracked
external dependencies (e.g., perform input/output or access global variables).
Tracing only records operations done when the given function is run on the given
tensors. Therefore, the returned <code>script_function</code> will always run the same traced
graph on any input. This has some important implications when your module is
expected to run different sets of operations, depending on the input and/or the
module state. For example,
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Tracing will not record any control-flow like if-statements or loops. When
this control-flow is constant across your module, this is fine and it often
inlines the control-flow decisions. But sometimes the control-flow is actually
part of the model itself. For instance, a recurrent network is a loop over
the (possibly dynamic) length of an input sequence.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> In the returned <code>script_function</code>, operations that have different behaviors
in training and eval modes will always behave as if it is in the mode it was
in during tracing, no matter which mode the <code>script_function</code> is in.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In cases like these, tracing would not be appropriate and scripting is a better
choice. If you trace such models, you may silently get incorrect results on
subsequent invocations of the model. The tracer will try to emit warnings when
doing something that may cause an incorrect trace to be produced.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Scripting is not yet supported in R.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">if (torch_is_installed()) {
fn &lt;- function(x) {
  torch_relu(x)
}
input &lt;- torch_tensor(c(-1, 0, 1))
tr_fn &lt;- jit_trace(fn, input)
tr_fn(input)
}
</code></pre>
