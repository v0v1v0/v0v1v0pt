<h2>Snip Parts of Tree Objects</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>snip.tree</code> has two related functions. If <code>nodes</code> is
supplied, it removes those nodes and all their descendants from the
tree.
</p>
<p>If <code>nodes</code> is not supplied, the user is invited to select nodes
interactively; this makes sense only if the tree has already been
plotted. A node is selected by clicking with the left mouse button;
its number and the deviance of the current tree and that which would
remain if that node were removed are printed. Selecting the same node
again causes it to be removed (and the lines of its sub-tree erased).
Clicking any other button terminates the selection process.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">snip.tree(tree, nodes, xy.save = FALSE,
          digits = getOption("digits") - 3)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tree</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of class <code>"tree"</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nodes</code></td>
<td>
<p>An integer vector giving those nodes that are the roots of
sub-trees to be snipped off. If missing, the user is invited to
select a node at which to snip.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>xy.save</code></td>
<td>
<p>If true, the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinates selected
interactively are saved as attribute <code>.xy</code> of the returned value.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>digits</code></td>
<td>
<p>Precision used in printing statistics for selected nodes.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A tree object containing the nodes that remain after
specified or selected subtrees have been snipped off.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Prior to version 1.0-34, the saved coordinates were place in object
<code>.xy</code> in the workspace.
