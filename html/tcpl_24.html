<h2>List of level 3 multiple-concentration normalization methods</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>mc3_mthds</code> returns a list of normalization methods to be used 
during level 3 multiple-concentration processing.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">mc3_mthds()
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The functions contained in the list returned by <code>mc3_mthds</code> take 
<code>aeids</code> (a numeric vector of aeid values) and returns a list of expressions 
to be executed in the <code>mc3</code> (not exported) function environment. The 
functions are described here for reference purposes, The 
<code>mc3_mthds</code> function is not exported, nor is it intended for use.
</p>
<p>All available methods are described in the Available Methods section, listed
by the type of function and the function/method name.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list of functions
</p>


<h3>Available Methods</h3>

<p>The methods are broken into three types, based on what fields they define. 
Different methods are used to define "bval" (the baseline value), "pval"
(the positive control value), and "resp" (the final response value). 
</p>
<p>Although it does not say so specifically in each description, all methods 
are applied by aeid.
</p>
<p>More information about the level 3 multiple-concentration processing is 
available in the package vignette, "Data_processing."
