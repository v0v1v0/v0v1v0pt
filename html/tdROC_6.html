<h2>Example data: Malignant Melanoma Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This example dataset is included for illustration. The Melano data is publicly available.
In 1962-1977, 205 patients with malignant melanoma (skin cancer) had a radical
operation performed at an academic medical center. At the end of the follow-up,
57 died from cancer, 14 died from other causes, and the other 134 patients were
alive (censored). This example dataset illustrates the prediction accuracy of
competing risk outcomes with baseline age and tumor thickness.
