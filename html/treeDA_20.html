<h2>Tree-based discriminant analysis</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A package for performing sparse, tree-based discriminant analysis.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This package contains functions for building sparse,
tree-structured models for classification. The method is based on
the idea that when our predictors are structured according to a
tree, we can create an expanded feature space containing both the
original leaf predictors as well as node predictors, which
correspond to sums or averages across the leaves descending from
them. Without some sort of regularization this problem would be
unidentifiable, but with the regularization provided by sparse
discriminant analysis we get stable solutions.
</p>
<p>The package fits a sparse discriminant model in the expanded
feature space and translates the results back to the leaf space, so
that the interpretation can be purely in terms of the original
predictors. The package also includes functions to perform cross
validation to pick the sparsity level and plotting commands to
visualize the tree and the fitted coefficient vectors.
</p>
<p>The main function in this package is <code>treeda</code>, which
fits a sparse tree-based discriminant model. Additional functions
provided are <code>treedacv</code>, which performs
cross-validation to determine the correct sparsity level, and
functions to plot the resulting coefficient vectors along the tree
(<code>plot_coefficients</code>).
