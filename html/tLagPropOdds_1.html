<h2>Estimation of the Probability of a Specific Categorical Outcome by Treatment</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Inverse probability weighted complete case (IPWCC) and augmented inverse 
probability weighted complete case (AIPWCC) estimators for the 
probability of falling into a specific time-lagged ordered categorical 
outcome in a randomized clinical trial.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">catProbs(data, ..., ti = NULL, td = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data.frame object. A data.frame containing all observed data.
At a minimum, this data.frame must contain columns with headers 
"id", "U", "delta", "Cat" and "A". If the time-independent component of
the estimator is to be included, data.frame must also contain the 
bases of f(X). If the time-dependent component is included, data.frame
must also contain the bases of h(X,L) as well as the time intervals with
column headers {"tstart", "tstop"} or {"start","stop"}. See Details for
additional information.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Ignored. Included to require named inputs.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ti</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character or integer vector or NULL. The columns of data to be
included in the time-independent component of the estimator, 
f_m(X) m = 0, ..., M.  If NULL, the time-independent component is excluded 
from the AIPWCC estimator. See Details for additional information.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>td</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character or integer vector or NULL. The columns of data to be
included in the time-dependent component of the estimator, 
h_l(X,Lbar), l = 1, ..., L. If NULL, the time-dependent component is 
excluded from the AIPWCC estimator. See Details for additional information.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>At a minimum, the data provided for the analysis must contain the
following information:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>id:</dt>
<dd>
<p>A unique participant identifier.</p>
</dd>
<dt>U:</dt>
<dd>
<p>The time to ascertainment of category or censoring.</p>
</dd>
<dt>delta:</dt>
<dd>
<p>The indicator of ascertainment of category (1 if U is 
the time to ascertainment;
0 otherwise).</p>
</dd>
<dt>Cat:</dt>
<dd>
<p>The ordered outcome category. Data must be provided as
a factor or an integer or be able to be converted to an 
integer without
loss of information. If participant was censored
(delta = 0), Cat can take any integer-like value or NA.</p>
</dd>
<dt>A:</dt>
<dd>
<p>The treatment received. Data must be provided as
a factor or an integer or be able to be converted to an 
integer without loss of information. </p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>With the exception of Cat, data must be complete.
</p>
<p>If the time-independent component is to be included in the AIPWCC estimator,
data must also include the time-independent basis functions 
f_m(X) m = 0, ..., M. If the intercept (f_0) term is not provided, it 
will be added by the software.
</p>
<p>If the time-dependent component is to be included in the AIPWCC estimator,
the data.frame must be a time-dependent dataset as described by package 
survival. Specifically, the time-dependent data must be specified for 
intervals (start,stop], and the data must include the following 
additional columns:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>tstart:</dt>
<dd>
<p>The lower boundary of the time interval to which the
data pertain.</p>
</dd>
<dt>tstop:</dt>
<dd>
<p>The upper boundary of the time interval to which the
data pertain.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that column headers {"start", "stop"} are also accepted.
</p>
<p>The various combinations of inputs ti and td yield the following:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>ti = NULL, td = NULL</dt>
<dd>
<p>the IPWCC estimate is returned. 
(denoted as IPW in the simulations of the original manuscript.)</p>
</dd>
<dt>ti != NULL, td != NULL</dt>
<dd>
<p>the IPWCC and the full 
AIPWCC estimates are returned. 
(denoted as AIPW2 in the simulations of the original manuscript.)</p>
</dd>
<dt>ti = NULL, td != NULL</dt>
<dd>
<p>the IPWCC and the partial, time-independent 
AIPWCC estimates are returned. 
(denoted as AIPW1 in the simulations of the original manuscript.)</p>
</dd>
<dt>ti = NULL, td != NULL</dt>
<dd>
<p>the IPWCC and the partial, time-dependent 
AIPWCC estimates are returned.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If a treatment subgroup has &lt;5% censoring, a message is generated and
the treatment subgroup is removed from the time-dependent component of the
AIPWCC estimator. If there is no censoring, the IPWCC estimator approaches
the usual proportional odds estimator.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An S3 object of class catProbsObj containing a list. The
elements of the list correspond to the selected AIPWCC and/or IPWCC
estimators. For each estimator, a list of matrix objects is returned,
one for each treatment, that
contains the estimated probabilities, their asymptotic standard errors, 
and the 95% confidence intervals. The
S3 object has an additional attributes, "type", giving a verbose 
description of the components contained in the estimator.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
data(tLagData)

# full AIPWCC estimator
catProbs(data = tLagData, ti = "x", td = c("hospStatus", "daysOut"))

# partial, time-independent AIPWCC estimator
catProbs(data = tLagData, ti = "x")

# partial, time-dependent AIPWCC estimator
catProbs(data = tLagData, td = c("hospStatus", "daysOut"))
