<h3>Details</h3>

<p>When estimating a tree specific taper curve based on given
measurements the residual variance of the model is taken into account to
estimate the tree specific random effects. Alternatively, it is possible to
make assumptions about the measurement error, eventually at specific
relative heights. With that, one can e.g. force the taper curve through the
given measurements. Standard behaviour not necessarily leads to passing the
measurements, if more than one is given.
</p>
<p>Different functions are available. <code>sig2</code> applies the model residual
variance and hence is the default behaviour.
<code>zero</code> means assuming no residual variance and forcing the taper curve
through the given measurements. Care has to be taken in this case because
forcing the taper curve through a lot of measurements might result in
implausible results.
<code>linear</code> interpolates between zero and the given residual variance along
the stem, i.e. from bottom to tree top.
<code>bilinear</code> puts zero variance not at zero but at a predefined location
(can be given via <code>par</code>). Below and above a linear interpolation is
done up to the given residual variance. If zero variance position is not
given, it is set at 5% of tree height (approximately height of dbh).
<code>laglinear</code> assumes zero variance up to a predefined location (defaults
to 5% of tree height) and interpolates upwards to the given residual
variance of the model.
<code>quadratic</code> function distributes residual variance according to a
quadratic function along the stem. It is build so that zero variance is put
at a predefined location (defaults to 5% of tree height) and model residual
variance (as a default) at tree top.
<code>dnorm</code> and <code>dlnorm</code> put residual variance in form of an inverse
normal or an inverse log-normal distribution along the stem with a
zero-minimum at a predefined location (defaults to 5% of tree height).
See examples for a visualisation.
</p>
<p>For all functions (except <code>zero</code> and <code>sig2</code>) the point of zero
residual variance is defined by <code>par$zrv</code> if given, otherwise set to 0.05.
For <code>dnorm</code> one can additionally provide the parameter <code>sd</code> to
determine standard deviation. By default it is set to <code>zrv/3</code>; in case
of <code>dlnorm</code> one can define <code>lsd</code> (sdlog, cf. <code>dlnorm</code>),
which is by default set to <code>1-sqrt(zrv)</code>. It is up to the user to define
meaningful parameters and use the functions in appropriate context.
