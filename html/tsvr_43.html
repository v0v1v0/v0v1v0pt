<h2>Percent cover data from Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve serpentine grassland site</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A data set of percent cover of plant species in a plot from Jasper Ridge Biological 
Preserve serpentine grassland site. See Hallett et al (2014), Ecology for details.
Subplot 3 from block 3 from the control treatment was used. Plot size was 1 m^2.
Values are percents. Values occasionally sum across species to more than 100 because
of overlapping plant canopies.
