<h2>Textrank - extract relevant keywords</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The textrank algorithm allows to find relevant keywords in text.
Where keywords are a combination of words following each other. <br></p>
<p>In order to find relevant keywords, the textrank algorithm constructs a word network. This
network is constructed by looking which words follow one another.
A link is set up between two words if they follow one another, the link gets a higher weight if these 2 words occur
more frequenctly next to each other in the text.<br>
On top of the resulting network the 'Pagerank' algorithm is applied to get the importance of each word.
The top 1/3 of all these words are kept and are considered relevant. After this, a keywords table is constructed
by combining the relevant words together if they appear following one another in the text.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">textrank_keywords(
  x,
  relevant = rep(TRUE, length(x)),
  p = 1/3,
  ngram_max = 5,
  sep = "-"
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character vector of words.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>relevant</code></td>
<td>
<p>a logical vector indicating if the word is relevant or not. In the standard textrank
algorithm, this is normally done by doing a Parts of Speech tagging and selecting which of the words are
nouns and adjectives.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>p</code></td>
<td>
<p>percentage (between 0 and 1) of relevant words to keep. Defaults to 1/3.
Can also be an integer which than indicates how many words to keep. Specify +Inf if you want to keep all words.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ngram_max</code></td>
<td>
<p>integer indicating to limit keywords which combine <code>ngram_max</code> combinations of words which follow one another</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sep</code></td>
<td>
<p>character string with the separator to <code>paste</code> the subsequent relevant words together</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>an object of class textrank_keywords
which is a list with elements:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> terms: a character vector of words from the word network with the highest pagerank
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> pagerank: the result of a call to <code>page_rank</code> on the word network
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> keywords: the data.frame with keywords containing columns keyword, ngram, freq indicating the keywords found and the frequency of occurrence
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> keywords_by_ngram: data.frame with columns keyword, ngram, freq indicating the keywords found and the frequency of occurrence
at each level of ngram. The difference with keywords being that if you have a sequence of words e.g. data science consultant, then in the keywords_by_ngram
you would still have the keywords data analysis and science consultant, while in the keywords list element you would only have data science consultant
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(joboffer)
keywords &lt;- textrank_keywords(joboffer$lemma,
                              relevant = joboffer$upos %in% c("NOUN", "VERB", "ADJ"))
subset(keywords$keywords, ngram &gt; 1 &amp; freq &gt; 1)
keywords &lt;- textrank_keywords(joboffer$lemma,
                              relevant = joboffer$upos %in% c("NOUN"),
                              p = 1/2, sep = " ")
subset(keywords$keywords, ngram &gt; 1)

## plotting pagerank to see the relevance of each word
barplot(sort(keywords$pagerank$vector), horiz = TRUE,
        las = 2, cex.names = 0.5, col = "lightblue", xlab = "Pagerank")
