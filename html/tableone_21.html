<h2>Create "Table 1" to describe baseline characteristics</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Creates "Table 1", i.e., description of baseline patient characteristics, which is essential in every medical research. Supports both continuous and categorical variables, as well as p-values and standardized mean differences. Weighted data are supported via the survey package. See github for a screencast. tableone was inspired by descriptive statistics functions in Deducer , a Java-based GUI package by Ian Fellows. This package does not require GUI or Java, and intended for command-line users. Most important functions are <code>CreateTableOne</code> and <code>svyCreateTableOne</code>.
