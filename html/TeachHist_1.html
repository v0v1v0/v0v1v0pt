<h2>TeachHist: A Collection of Amended Histograms Designed for Teaching Statistics</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Statistics students often have problems understanding
the relation between a random variable's true scale and its z-values.
To allow instructors to better visualize histograms for these
students, the package provides histograms with two horizontal
axis containing z-values and the true scale of the variable.
The function TeachHistDens() provides a density histogram with two axis.
TeachHistCounts() and TeachHistRelFreq() are variations for count and
relative frequency histograms, respectively. TeachConfInterv() and
TeachHypTest() help instructors to visualize confidence levels
and the results of hypothesis tests.
</p>

count histograms.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TeachHistRelFreq is a variation of TeachHistDens() for
relative frequency histograms.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TeachHistConfInterv helps to visualize confidence levels
