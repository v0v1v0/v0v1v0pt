<h2>Tidy eval helpers</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>


<ul>
<li> <p><code>sym</code> creates a symbol from a string and
<code>syms</code> creates a list of symbols from a
character vector.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>enquo</code> and
<code>enquos</code> delay the execution of one or
several function arguments. <code>enquo()</code> returns a single quoted
expression, which is like a blueprint for the delayed computation.
<code>enquos()</code> returns a list of such quoted expressions.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>expr</code> quotes a new expression <em>locally</em>. It
is mostly useful to build new expressions around arguments
captured with <code>enquo()</code> or <code>enquos()</code>:
<code>expr(mean(!!enquo(arg), na.rm = TRUE))</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>as_name</code> transforms a quoted variable name
into a string. Supplying something else than a quoted variable
name is an error.
</p>
<p>That's unlike <code>as_label</code> which also returns
a single string but supports any kind of R object as input,
including quoted function calls and vectors. Its purpose is to
summarise that object into a single label. That label is often
suitable as a default name.
</p>
<p>If you don't know what a quoted expression contains (for instance
expressions captured with <code>enquo()</code> could be a variable
name, a call to a function, or an unquoted constant), then use
<code>as_label()</code>. If you know you have quoted a simple variable
name, or would like to enforce this, use <code>as_name()</code>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Nothing returned.
This is to document important functions from <code>rlang</code> that are used internal to this R package.
