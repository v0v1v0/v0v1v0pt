<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>specialHolidayGB</code> gives the special Bank holidays in England for
the years specified by argument <code>year</code>, such as the Millenium day
at the end of 1999 and significant Royal events. Don't assume that
there is at most one special holiday in a given year, 2022 had two.
</p>
<p>Years that do not contain special Bank holidays are omitted. If there
are no special holidays in the specified year(s) the results is a
<code>"timeDate"</code> or <code>"character"</code> object of length zero.
</p>
<p>The holidays are sorted in increasing time order. 
</p>
<p>Argument <code>value</code> controls the class of the result. The default is
<code>"timeDate"</code>. The result is a character vector if <code>value =
  ""</code> (the empty string). In the latter case, further arguments for the
transformation to <code>character</code> can be passed in argument
<code>"..."</code> (e.g., <code>format</code>). 
</p>
<p>If argument <code>named</code> is <code>TRUE</code>, the dates get names
asssociated with them, so one can see which date represents which
holiday.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a <code>"timeDate"</code> or a character vector, as requested by argument
<code>value</code>
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>While most of the holidays given by the functions with prefix
<code>GBxxx</code> are valid for the UK as a whole and they are (or should be)
fully correct for England, there are variations in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland. 
</p>
<p>Functions containing 'London' in their name refer to the London Stock
Exchange. Currently, the Bank holidays given by those functions are
the same as for England. Actually, the 'official' holidays between
1834 and 1870 were set by the Bank of England. The first Act of
Parlament on the issue is from 1871.
