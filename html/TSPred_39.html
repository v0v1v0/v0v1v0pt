<h2>Electrical loads regressors of the EUNITE Competition</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The EUNITE Competition dataset containing a set of variables serving as
regressors for the electrical loads measured between 1997 and 1998 in
<code>EUNITE.Loads</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">EUNITE.Reg
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 730 observations on the following 2 variables.
</p>
 <dl>
<dt>Holiday</dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector containing daily data on
the holidays for the time period 1997-1998. Composed of binary values where
1 represents a holiday and 0 a common day.</p>
</dd> <dt>Weekday</dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric
vector containing daily data on the weekdays for the time period 1997-1998.
Composed of integer values where 1 represents a Sunday, 2 a Monday, 3 a
Tuesday, 4 a Wednesday, 5 a Thursday, 6 a Friday and 7 a Saturday.</p>
</dd> </dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The EUNITE Competition proposed the prediction of maximum daily electrical
loads based on half-an-hour loads (<code>EUNITE.Loads</code>) and average
daily temperatures of 1997-1998 (<code>EUNITE.Temp</code>). Competitors
were asked to predict the 31 values corresponding to the daily maximum
electrical loads of January 1999 (<code>EUNITE.Loads.cont</code>). For the
posed prediction problem, it is useful to consider as regressors the
holidays and the weekdays with respect to this period in
<code>EUNITE.Reg</code>, which are expected to have a considerable impact
on the electrical consumption.
