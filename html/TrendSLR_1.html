<h2>TrendSLR: A package providing improved techniques to estimate mean sea level
(trend), velocity and acceleration from sea level records.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The “TrendSLR” package provides improved estimates of mean sea level (trend)
and associated real-time velocities and accelerations from individual, annual
average ocean water level data records. Improved trend estimates are based on
Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) methods. Various gap-filling options are included
to accommodate incomplete time series records along with a range of diagnostic
tools to investigate the SSA decomposition of the time series. A wide range of
screen and plot to file options are available within the package.
</p>


<h3>TrendSLR functions</h3>

<p>The <code>msl.trend</code> function is one of the key functions of the package
deconstructing annual average time series into a trend and
associated velocities and accelerations, filling necessary internal structures
which facilitate all functions in this package. The fixed settings built into
this function are based on the detailed research and development summarised
in Watson (2016a,b; 2018).
</p>
<p>The <code>custom.trend</code> function is the other key function which permits
customisation of key input parameters to enable improved isolation of trend
components (mean sea level) and estimated associated velocities and accelerations.
This function provides more flexibility for the expert analyst than the
<code>msl.trend</code> function with fixed inbuilt parameterisation.
