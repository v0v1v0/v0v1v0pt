<h2>
A function to download the most recent url-tables for some traitbases.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>For some traitbases tr8 uses lookup-tables which contain URLs of the
species of interest; some of the traitbases queried by tr8 are
uploaded from time to time thus the function may be unable to retrieve
traits data for the most recently uploaded species.
This function allows the user to refresh some of these lookup tables.
<b>BEWARE</b>: this function takes a long time to run (nearly 20
minutes are required - on a fast connection - for retrieving lookup
tables for BiolFlor). 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">tr8_setup()
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>At the moment BiolFlor and Ecoflora lookup tables are re-generated by this function.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The values does not return anythis useful for the user; it's used for
its side effects, i.e. it stores the retrieved lookup table in one
directory for later use from the <code>tr8</code> function.
</p>


<h3>Warning </h3>

<p>The function takes a lot to run; I suggest to run it just at your
first installation of the <code>TR8</code> package.
