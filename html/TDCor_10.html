<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Vector containing the prior associated with the genes included in the network reconstruction in Lavenus et al. 2015, Plant Cell.<br></p>
<p>By defining the <code>l_prior</code> vector, the user defines which genes should be regarded as positive regulators, which others as negative regulators and which can only be targets. The prior code is defined as follow: -1 for negative regulator; 0 for non-regulator (target only); 1 for positive regulator; 2 for both positive and negative regulator. The i-th element of the vector is the prior to associate to the i-th gene in <code>l_genes</code>.
