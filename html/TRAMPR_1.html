<h2>The TRAMPR Package (TRFLP Analysis and Matching Package for R)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package contains a collection of functions to help
analyse terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP)
profiles, by matching unknown peaks to known TRFLP profiles in order
to identify species.
</p>
<p>The <code>TRAMPR</code> package contains a vignette, which includes a worked
example; type <code>vignette("TRAMPRdemo")</code> to view it.  To see all
documented help topics, type <code>library(help=TRAMPR)</code>.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Start by reading the <code>TRAMP</code> (and perhaps
<code>create.diffsmatrix</code>) help pages, which explain the
matching algorithm.
</p>
<p>Then read <code>load.abi</code> to learn how to load ABI format data
into the program.  Alternatively, read <code>TRAMPsamples</code> and
<code>read.TRAMPsamples</code> to load already-processed data.
</p>
<p>If you already have a collection of knowns, read
<code>TRAMPknowns</code> and <code>read.TRAMPknowns</code> to learn
how to load them.  Otherwise, read <code>build.knowns</code> to learn
how to automatically generate a set of known profiles from your data.
</p>
<p>Once your data are loaded, reread <code>TRAMP</code> to do the
analysis, then read <code>plot.TRAMP</code> and
<code>summary.TRAMP</code> to examine the analysis.
<code>update.TRAMP</code> may also be useful for modifying your
matches.  <code>summary.TRAMP</code> is also useful for preparing
presence/absence matrices for analysis with other tools (e.g. the
<span class="pkg">vegan</span> package; see the vignette indicated below).
</p>
<p><span class="pkg">TRAMPR</span> works with database-like objects, and a basic
understanding of relational databases and primary/foreign keys will
aid in understanding some aspects of the package.
</p>

<h3>Note</h3>

<p><span class="pkg">TRAMPR</span> is designed specifically for “database TRFLP”
(identifying species based on a database of known TRFLP profiles: see
Dicke et al. 2002.  It is not designed for direct community analysis
of TRFLP profiles as in peak-profile TRFLP.
