<h2>Select specific nodes or edges to compute on</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>focus()</code>/<code>unfocus()</code> idiom allow you to temporarily tell tidygraph
algorithms to only calculate on a subset of the data, while keeping the full
graph intact. The purpose of this is to avoid having to calculate time
costly measures etc on all nodes or edges of a graph if only a few is needed.
E.g. you might only be interested in the shortest distance from one node to
another so rather than calculating this for all nodes you apply a focus on
one node and perform the calculation. It should be made clear that not all
algorithms will see a performance boost by being applied to a few nodes/edges
since their calculation is applied globally and the result for all
nodes/edges are provided in unison.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">focus(.data, ...)

## S3 method for class 'tbl_graph'
focus(.data, ...)

## S3 method for class 'morphed_tbl_graph'
focus(.data, ...)

unfocus(.data, ...)

## S3 method for class 'tbl_graph'
unfocus(.data, ...)

## S3 method for class 'focused_tbl_graph'
unfocus(.data, ...)

## S3 method for class 'morphed_tbl_graph'
unfocus(.data, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>.data</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame, data frame extension (e.g. a tibble), or a
lazy data frame (e.g. from dbplyr or dtplyr). See <em>Methods</em>, below, for
more details.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>&lt;<code>data-masking</code>&gt; Expressions that
return a logical value, and are defined in terms of the variables in
<code>.data</code>. If multiple expressions are included, they are combined with the
<code>&amp;</code> operator. Only rows for which all conditions evaluate to <code>TRUE</code> are
kept.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A graph with focus applied
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>focusing is the lowest prioritised operation on a graph. Applying a
<code>morph()</code> or a <code>group_by()</code> operation will unfocus the graph prior to
performing the operation. The same is true for the inverse operations
(<code>unmorph()</code> and <code>ungroup()</code>). Further, unfocusing will happen any time some
graph altering operation is performed, such as the <code>arrange()</code> and <code>slice()</code>
operations
