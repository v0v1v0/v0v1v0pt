<h2>tidyLPA: Functionality to carry out Latent Profile Analysis in R</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) is a statistical modeling approach for
estimating distinct profiles, or groups, of variables. In the social
sciences and in educational research, these profiles could represent, for
example, how different youth experience dimensions of being engaged (i.e.,
cognitively, behaviorally, and affectively) at the same time.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>tidyLPA provides the functionality to carry out LPA in R. In particular,
tidyLPA provides functionality to specify different models that determine
whether and how different parameters (i.e., means, variances, and
covariances) are estimated and to specify (and compare solutions for) the
number of profiles to estimate.
