<h2>Operating Characteristic (OC) Curves for K-Factors for Tolerance Intervals Based on Normality</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Provides OC-type curves to illustrate how values of the k-factors for normal tolerance intervals, confidence levels, and content levels change as a function of the sample size.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">norm.OC(k = NULL, alpha = NULL, P = NULL, n, side = 1,
        method = c("HE", "HE2", "WBE", "ELL", "KM", "EXACT", 
        "OCT"), m = 50)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>k</code></td>
<td>
<p>If wanting OC curves where the confidence level or content level is on the y-axis, then a single positive value of <code>k</code> must be specified.  This would be the target k-factor for the desired tolerance interval.  If <code>k = NULL</code>, then OC curves will be constructed where the k-factor value is found for given levels of <code>alpha</code>, <code>P</code>, and <code>n</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>alpha</code></td>
<td>
<p>The set of levels chosen such that <code>1-alpha</code> are confidence levels.  If wanting OC curves where the content level is being calculated, then each curve will correspond to a level in the set of <code>alpha</code>.  If a set of <code>P</code> values is specified, then OC curves will be constructed where the k-factor is found and each curve will correspond to each combination of <code>alpha</code> and <code>P</code>.  If <code>alpha = NULL</code>, then OC curves will be constructed to find the confidence level for given levels of <code>k</code>, <code>P</code>, and <code>n</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>P</code></td>
<td>
<p>The set of content levels to be considered.  If wanting OC curves where the confidence level is being calculated, then each curve will correspond to a level in the set of <code>P</code>.  If a set of <code>alpha</code> values is specified, then OC curves will be constructed where the k-factor is found and each curve will correspond to each combination of <code>alpha</code> and <code>P</code>.  If <code>P = NULL</code>, then OC curves will be constructed to find the content level for given levels of <code>k</code>, <code>alpha</code>, and <code>n</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n</code></td>
<td>
<p>A sequence of sample sizes to consider.  This must be a vector of at least length 2 since all OC curves are constructed as functions of <code>n</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>side</code></td>
<td>
<p>Whether a 1-sided or 2-sided tolerance interval is required (determined by <code>side = 1</code> or <code>side = 2</code>, respectively).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>The method for calculating the k-factors.  The k-factor for the 1-sided tolerance intervals
is performed exactly and thus is the same for the chosen method.  <code>"HE"</code> is the
Howe method and is often viewed as being extremely accurate, even for small sample sizes. <code>"HE2"</code> is a second method due to Howe, which performs similarly to the Weissberg-Beatty method, but is computationally simpler.  <code>"WBE"</code> is the 
Weissberg-Beatty method (also called the Wald-Wolfowitz method), which performs similarly to the first Howe method for larger sample sizes. <code>"ELL"</code> is
the Ellison correction to the Weissberg-Beatty method when <code>f</code> is appreciably larger than <code>n^2</code>. A warning
message is displayed if <code>f</code> is not larger than <code>n^2</code>. <code>"KM"</code> is the Krishnamoorthy-Mathew approximation to the exact solution, which works well for larger sample sizes. <code>"EXACT"</code> computes the 
k-factor exactly by finding the integral solution to the problem via the <code>integrate</code> function.  Note the computation time of this method is largely determined by <code>m</code>. <code>"OCT"</code> is the Owen approach 
to compute the k-factor when controlling the tails so that there is not more than (1-P)/2  of the data in each tail of the distribution.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>m</code></td>
<td>
<p>The maximum number of subintervals to be used in the <code>integrate</code> function, which is used for the underlying exact method for calculating the normal tolerance intervals.</p>
</td>
</tr>
