<h2>Dynamic Ensembles for Time Series Forecasting</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package implements ensemble methods for time series
forecasting tasks. Dynamically combining different forecasting models
is a common approach to tackle these problems.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The main methods in <strong>tsensembler</strong> are in <code>ADE-class</code> and
<code>DETS-class</code>:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>ADE</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Arbitrated Dynamic Ensemble (ADE) is an ensemble
approach for dynamically combining forecasting models using
a metalearning strategy called arbitrating. A meta model is
trained for each base model in the ensemble. Each meta-learner is
specifically designed to model the error of its associate
across the time series. At forecasting time, the base models
are weighted according to their degree of competence in the
input observation, estimated by the predictions of the meta models</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>DETS</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Dynamic Ensemble for Time Series (DETS) is
similar to <strong>ADE</strong> in the sense that it adaptively combines
the base models in an ensemble for time series forecasting. DETS
follows a more traditional approach for forecaster combination. It
pre-trains a set of heterogeneous base models, and at run-time
weights them dynamically according to recent performance. Like <strong>ADE</strong>,
the ensemble includes a committee, which dynamically selects a
subset of base models that are weighted with a non-linear function</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The ensemble methods can be used to <code>predict</code> new observations
or <code>forecast</code> future values of a time series. They can also be
updated using generic functions (check see also section).
