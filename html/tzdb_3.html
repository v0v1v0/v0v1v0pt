<h2>Initialize tzdb for usage in other packages</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>tzdb_initialize()</code> is intended to be called from a client package's
<code>.onLoad()</code> as <code>tzdb::tzdb_initialize()</code> to ensure that the tzdb package
has been loaded.
</p>
<p>The function itself doesn't do anything. It is instead called for the
side-effect of loading the tzdb package. This does two things:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> The tzdb <code>.onLoad()</code> hook is run, which sets the path to the time zone
database.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The callables in tzdb are registered, which allows them to be called from
other packages.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">tzdb_initialize()
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>There are alternative ways to ensure that tzdb is loaded. A client package
can alternatively import a function from tzdb into its package with the
<code style="white-space: pre;">⁠@importFrom⁠</code> tag, or can call <code>requireNamespace("tzdb", quiet = TRUE)</code> from
its <code>.onLoad()</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>NULL</code>, invisibly.
