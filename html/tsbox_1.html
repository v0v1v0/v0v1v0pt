<h2>tsbox: Class-Agnostic Time Series</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The R ecosystem knows a vast number of time series classes: ts, xts, zoo,
tsibble, tibbletime, tis, or timeSeries. The plethora of standards causes
confusion.
As different packages rely on different classes, it is hard to use them in
the same analysis. tsbox provides a set of tools that make it easy to switch
between these classes. It also allows the user to treat time series as plain
data frames, facilitating the use with tools that assume rectangular data.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The package is built around a set of functions that convert time series of
different classes to each other. They are frequency-agnostic, and allow the
user to combine multiple non-standard and irregular frequencies. Because
coercion works reliably, it is easy to write functions that work identically
for all classes. So whether we want to smooth, scale, differentiate,
chain-link, forecast, regularize or seasonally adjust a time series, we can
use the same tsbox-command for any time series classes.

<p>The best way to start is to check out the package
<a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/tsbox/">website</a>.
</p>
<p>In the <em>ropensci</em> classification, this package is <em>An improvement on other
implementations of similar algorithms in <strong>R</strong></em>. Many time series packages,
e.g., <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=zoo">zoo</a> or
<a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tsibble">tsibble</a> contain converter
functions from one class to another. They often convert from their class
to <code>ts</code> objects and back, but lack converters to other time series class.
</p>
<p>In most cases, tsbox transforms an object into an augmented <code>data.table</code>. And
uses the <code>data.table</code> infrastructure for efficient joining and reshaping. After
computation, it restores the original input class. This restoring feature is
was also used in the <code>xts::reclass()</code> function of the
<a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=xts">xts</a> package.
