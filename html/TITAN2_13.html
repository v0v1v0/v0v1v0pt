<h2>Sum IndVal z scores across taxa</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function uses the output of 'getivz' (and, optionally, similar output
from the bootstrap procedure) to sum z scores across taxa associated with
each indicator direction (- or +) at each level of the environmental
gradient.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">ivzsums(allivz)

ivzsums.f(allivz, sppmax)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>allivz</code></td>
<td>
<p>The output matrix from the function 'getivz' that contains four
submatrices, the first two of which include indicator direction and z
scores.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sppmax</code></td>
<td>
<p>A completed summary output table for all taxa, used to
ascertain which taxa should be filtered and which retained.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function selects taxa identified as either increasing or decreasing at
each level of the environmental gradient and combines their IndVal z scores
to generate an assemblage-wide sum.  The sum(z) scores are interpreted as the
magnitude of community change at each level of the environmental gradient.
</p>
<p>The alias 'ivzsums.f' uses the output of 'getivz' to sum z scores across taxa
filtered by purity and reliability associated with each indicator direction
(- or +) at each level of the environmental gradient.  Filters are provided
by the final column ("filter") in the 'sppmax' table that is part of each
TITAN object and an argument for 'ivzsums.f'.  All taxa with a value of
either 1 or 2 are pure and reliable decreasers or increasers, respectively,
and are selected for summation.  Filtered sums are used by the 'plot.sumz'
function to create estimates of robust community change more precise than the
original unfiltered sum(z) in TITAN v1.0.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A matrix of two (z- and z+) parallel vectors with length (nrow) equal
to the number of candidate partitions of an environmental gradient.
