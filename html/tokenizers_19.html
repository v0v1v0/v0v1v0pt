<h2>Word stem tokenizer</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function turns its input into a character vector of word stems. This is
just a wrapper around the <code>wordStem</code> function from the
SnowballC package which does the heavy lifting, but this function provides a
consistent interface with the rest of the tokenizers in this package. The
input can be a character vector of any length, or a list of character vectors
where each character vector in the list has a length of 1.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">tokenize_word_stems(
  x,
  language = "english",
  stopwords = NULL,
  simplify = FALSE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector or a list of character vectors to be tokenized.
If <code>x</code> is a character vector, it can be of any length, and each
element will be tokenized separately. If <code>x</code> is a list of character
vectors, where each element of the list should have a length of 1.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>language</code></td>
<td>
<p>The language to use for word stemming. This must be one of
the languages available in the SnowballC package. A list is provided by
<code>getStemLanguages</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>stopwords</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector of stop words to be excluded</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>simplify</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>FALSE</code> by default so that a consistent value is
returned regardless of length of input. If <code>TRUE</code>, then an input with
a single element will return a character vector of tokens instead of a
list.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function will strip all white space and punctuation and make
all word stems lowercase.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list of character vectors containing the tokens, with one element
in the list for each element that was passed as input. If <code>simplify =
  TRUE</code> and only a single element was passed as input, then the output is a
character vector of tokens.
