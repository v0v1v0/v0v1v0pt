<h2>Compute the diversity associated to a random walk following a path between the levels
of a tripartite graph.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>get_diversity_from_path</code> computes diversity values of the probability distribution of a
random walk following a <code>path</code> between the different levels of the input <code>tripartite</code>
graph. It starts at a given level with an initial probability distribution, then randomly follows
the links of the graph between the different levels according to the input <code>path</code>, then
stops at the last specified level. The implemented diversity measures all belong to the
parametrized family of "True Diversity" measures. They can either be specified by their diversity
<code>order</code> in [<code>0</code>,<code>Inf</code>[ or by their <code>measure</code> name when it corresponds to
classical instances such as the richness, the Shannon entropy, the Herfindahl-Hirschman index,
or the Berger-Parker index.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">get_diversity_from_path(tripartite, path, conditional_path = NULL,
  initial_distribution = NULL, initial_node = NULL, order = NULL,
  measure = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tripartite</code></td>
<td>
<p>A tripartite graph obtained by calling the <code>get_tripartite</code> function.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>path</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of integers in {<code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>} giving the path of the random
walk between the different levels of the input <code>tripartite</code> graph. This path can be as long
as wanted. Two successive levels should always be adjacent, that is the random walk cannot go from
level <code>1</code> to level <code>3</code> (or conversely) without first going through level <code>2</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>conditional_path</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of integers in {<code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>} eventually
giving another path to compute conditional diversity values instead of regular diversity
values. When specified, this conditional
path is first used to initiate the random walk. The resulting probability distribution is then
used to weight the individual diversity values obtained on the input <code>path</code> when computing
their geometric means (see
<code>get_conditional_diversity_from_transition</code>). This path can be as long
as wanted. The last level of the conditional path should be the same as the first level of the
input <code>path</code>. Moreover, two successive levels should always be adjacent, that is the random
walk cannot go from
level <code>1</code> to level <code>3</code> (or conversely) without first going through level <code>2</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>initial_distribution</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of floats in [<code>0</code>,<code>1</code>] and summing to
<code>1</code> giving the probability
distribution to start with at the first level of the input <code>path</code>, or at the first level
of the input <code>conditional_path</code> if specified. It should hence
contain as many values as there are nodes in the corresponding level. If not specified, this
distribution is assumed uniform.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>initial_node</code></td>
<td>
<p>A string giving the name of a node in the first level of the input
<code>path</code>, or at the first level of the input <code>conditional_path</code> if specified.
This node is then considered to have probability one, thus being equivalent to
specifying an <code>initial_distribution</code> with only zeros except for one node. If not specified,
no such node is defined and the initial distribution is assumed uniform.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>order</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of positive floats (possibly including <code>Inf</code>) giving the
orders of the diversity measures to be computed. If neither <code>order</code> nor <code>measure</code> is
specified, a predefined list of 8 diversity measures is computed.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>measure</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of strings giving the names of the diversity measures to compute.
Possible values are <code>richness</code>, <code>entropy</code>, <code>herfindahl</code>,
and <code>bergerparker</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A vector of positive floats giving the diversity values (or conditional diversity values)
of the random walk following the input <code>path</code>.
