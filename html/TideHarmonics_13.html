<h2>Sea-Level Data At Hillarys</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>Hillarys</code> data frame has 26304 rows and 2 variables. It
gives hourly sea-levels in metres (above Tide Gauge Zero) recorded 
by the tide gauge within the (UTC) years of 2012-2014. The sea-levels 
are in the second column. The first column is a POSIXct object 
giving the dates and times in UTC.
</p>
<p>Hillarys is one of the sites currently used for the Australian
Baseline Sea-Level Monitoring Project (ABSLMP). Hourly data for
these sites is available from the Australian Bureau of
Meteorology.
</p>
<p>To obtain the sea-level in AHD (Australian Height Datum), you
will need to subtract 0.763 metres from the values given in the
dataset.
</p>
<p>Hillarys is located in the south-west of Australia, where tides
are typically diurnal (i.e. one high tide per day). The 
amplitudes of K1 and O1 will likely be larger than the 
amplitudes of M2 and S2.
</p>
<p>This dataset is is used for the examples in the help files.
