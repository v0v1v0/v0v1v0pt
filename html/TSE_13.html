<h2>A data set created by merging four smaller data sets.  Three of those smaller data sets are data from
three surveys (O1, O2, O3); the other is data from a "gold standard" survey (A1).  All four smaller data
sets consist of the same three variables (Q1, Q2, Q3): responses to the same three questions, asked
by each survey from the same 10 respondents (ID), along the same 1-99 response scale.</h2>
