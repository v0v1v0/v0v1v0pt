<h2>Equal weight Fama-French portfolio returns data.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Equal weight Fama-French portfolio returns data formed on size and operating profitability of Chen and Lam (2023).
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A 576 × 10 × 10 'Tensor' object defined in package <span class="pkg">rTensor</span>, where mode-1,2,3 correspond to time, OP levels and size levels, respectively.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Stocks are categorized into 10 different sizes (market equity, using NYSE market equity deciles) and 10 different
operating profitability (OP) levels (using NYSE OP deciles. OP is annual revenues minus cost of goods
sold, interest expense, and selling, general, and administrative expenses divided by book equity for the last
fiscal year end). The stocks in each of the 10 × 10 categories form a portfolio by equal weight. We use monthly data from July 1973 to June 2021, so that T = 576, and each
data tensor we have thus has size 10 × 10 × 576. Since the market factor is certainly pervasive in financial returns, we use the CAPM to remove
its effects and facilitate detection of potentially weaker factors.
