<h2>trackeR: Infrastructure for running and cycling data from
GPS-enabled tracking devices</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>trackeR provides infrastructure for handling cycling and running
data from GPS-enabled tracking devices. After extraction and appropriate
manipulation of the training or competition attributes, the data are placed into
session-aware data objects with an S3 class trackeRdata. The information in the
resultant data objects can then be visualised, summarised and analysed through
corresponding flexible and extensible methods.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Core facilities in the trackeR package, including reading functions
(see <code>readX</code>), data pre-processing strategies (see
<code>trackeRdata</code>), and calculation of concentration and
distribution profiles (see <code>distributionProfile</code> and
<code>concentrationProfile</code>) are based on un-packaged R code
that was developed by Ioannis Kosmidis for the requirements of the
analyses in Kosmidis &amp; Passfield (2015).

<p>This work has been supported by the English Institute of Sport
(currently UK Sports Institute)
<a href="https://uksportsinstitute.co.uk">https://uksportsinstitute.co.uk</a> and University College London
(UCL), which jointly contributed to the grant that funded Hannah
Frick's Post Doctoral Research Fellowship at UCL between 2014 and
2016 and a percentage of Ioannis Kosmidis' time. Ioannis Kosmidis
has also been supported by the Alan Turing Institute under the
EPSRC grant EP/N510129/1 (Turing award number TU/B/000082). The
support of the aforementioned organisations is greatly
acknowledged.
