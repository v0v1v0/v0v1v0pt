<h3>Description</h3>

<p>PITCHf/x data on Justin Verlander, winner of the 2011 Cy Young Award.  Covers his 
2009 through 2012 seasons.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 15307 observations on the following 12 variables.  Each observation
is a single pitch.
</p>
 <dl>
<dt>season</dt>
<dd>
<p>The year of play</p>
</dd>
<dt>gamedate</dt>
<dd>
<p>Date of the game in which the pitch was thrown</p>
</dd>
<dt>pitch_type</dt>
<dd>
<p>Type of pitch thrown:  CH (Change-up), CU (Curveball), FF (Four-Seam Fastball),
FT (Two-Seam Fastball), SL (Slider).  Pitch type is determined by computer algorithm.</p>
</dd>
<dt>balls</dt>
<dd>
<p>Current ball count</p>
</dd>
<dt>strikes</dt>
<dd>
<p>Current strike count</p>
</dd>
<dt>pitches</dt>
<dd>
<p>number of pitches previously thrown in the game</p>
</dd>
<dt>speed</dt>
<dd>
<p>speed of pitch (in mph).  (When crossing plate?)</p>
</dd>
<dt>px</dt>
<dd>
<p>x-coordinate of pitch (in feet, measured from center of plate)</p>
</dd>
<dt>pz</dt>
<dd>
<p>vertical coordinate of pitch (in feet above plate)</p>
</dd>
<dt>pfx_x</dt>
<dd>
<p>the horizontal movement, in inches, of the pitch between the release point and 
home plate, as compared to a theoretical pitch thrown at the same speed with no spin-induced 
movement. Measured at 40 feet from home plate.</p>
</dd>
<dt>pfx_z</dt>
<dd>
<p>the vertical movement, in inches, of the pitch between the release point and 
home plate, as compared to a theoretical pitch thrown at the same speed with no spin-induced 
movement. Measured at 40 feet from home plate.</p>
</dd>
<dt>batter_hand</dt>
<dd>
<p>A factor with two values: L (left) and R (right).</p>
</dd>
