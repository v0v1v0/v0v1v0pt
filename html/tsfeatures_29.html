<h2>How median depend on distributional outliers from software package <code>hctsa</code>
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Measures median as more and
more outliers are included in the calculation according to a specified rule,
of outliers being furthest from the mean.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">outlierinclude_mdrmd(y, zscored = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>y</code></td>
<td>
<p>the input time series (ideally z-scored)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>zscored</code></td>
<td>
<p>Should y be z-scored before computing the statistic. Default: TRUE</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The threshold for including time-series data points in the analysis increases
from zero to the maximum deviation, in increments of 0.01*sigma (by default),
where sigma is the standard deviation of the time series.
</p>
<p>At each threshold,  proportion of time series points
included and median are calculated, and outputs from the
algorithm measure how these statistical quantities change as more extreme
points are included in the calculation.
</p>
<p>Outliers are defined as furthest from the mean.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>median  of the median of range indices
</p>
