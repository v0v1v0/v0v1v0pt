<h2>Autocorrelation-based features</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Computes various measures based on autocorrelation coefficients of the
original series, first-differenced series and second-differenced series
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">acf_features(x)

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A vector of 6 values: first autocorrelation coefficient and sum of squared of
first ten autocorrelation coefficients of original series, first-differenced series,
and twice-differenced series.
For seasonal data, the autocorrelation coefficient at the first seasonal lag is
also returned.
