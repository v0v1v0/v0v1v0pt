<h2>Names Of Commonly Used Harmonic Constituents</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These vectors give names of commonly used harmonic constituents.
</p>
<p>The <code>hc114</code> vector gives the first 114 of the 115 constituents
listed in the TASK-2000 software manual. The order is the same as
that given in the manual. The 115th constituent has the same speed 
(but a different nodal correction) as the constituent L2. It is 
omitted because it probably not sensible to include both.
</p>
<p>The <code>hc60</code> vector gives the first 60 of the 115 constituents
listed in the TASK-2000 software manual. The order is the same as
that given in the manual (which is in order of speed).
</p>
<p>The <code>hc37</code> vector gives the 37 constituents that are used by
the NOAA, in the sense that they are publicly available on the
NOAA website (for USA sites). They are listed in NOAA order. Note
that NOAA uses constituents S6 and M8, but neither are contained in
<code>hc60</code>, and S6 is not contained in <code>hc114</code>.
</p>
<p>The <code>hc7</code> vector gives the seven major constituents 
M2 S2 N2 K2 K1 O1 P1.
</p>
<p>The <code>hc4</code> vector gives the four major constituents 
M2 S2 K1 O1. Unless you are investigating single constituents,
it is recommended that these four are always included because
they are fundamental to the classification of a site as
semi-diurnal, mixed semi-diurnal or diurnal. 
</p>
<p>The <code>task</code> vector gives the same constituents as <code>hc114</code>
but using the TASK-2000 names. The <code>noaa</code> vector gives the 
same constituents as <code>hc37</code> but using the NOAA names.
The package is written to be robust to different naming schemes,
and therefore any of these vectors can be used as the <code>hcn</code>
argument to the <code>ftide</code> function.
