<h2>Monotonic attention</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Compute monotonic attention distribution from choosing probabilities.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">attention_monotonic(p_choose_i, previous_attention, mode)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>p_choose_i</code></td>
<td>
<p>Probability of choosing input sequence/memory element i.
Should be of shape (batch_size, input_sequence_length), and should all be
in the range [0, 1].</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>previous_attention</code></td>
<td>
<p>The attention distribution from the previous output
timestep. Should be of shape (batch_size, input_sequence_length). For the first
output timestep, preevious_attention[n] should be [1, 0, 0, ..., 0] for all n
in [0, ... batch_size - 1].</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mode</code></td>
<td>
<p>How to compute the attention distribution. Must be one of 'recursive',
'parallel', or 'hard'.  'recursive' uses tf$scan to recursively compute the
distribution. This is slowest but is exact, general, and does not suffer from
numerical instabilities.  'parallel' uses parallelized cumulative-sum and
cumulative-product operations to compute a closed-form solution to the recurrence
relation defining the attention distribution. This makes it more efficient than
'recursive', but it requires numerical checks which make the distribution non-exact.
This can be a problem in particular when input_sequence_length is long and/or p_choose_i
has entries very close to 0 or 1. * 'hard' requires that the probabilities in p_choose_i
are all either 0 or 1, and subsequently uses a more efficient and exact solution.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Monotonic attention implies that the input sequence is processed in an
explicitly left-to-right manner when generating the output sequence. In
addition, once an input sequence element is attended to at a given output
timestep, elements occurring before it cannot be attended to at subsequent
output timesteps. This function generates attention distributions
according to these assumptions. For more information, see 'Online and
Linear-Time Attention by Enforcing Monotonic Alignments'.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A tensor of shape (batch_size, input_sequence_length) representing
the attention distributions for each sequence in the batch.
</p>


<h3>Raises</h3>

<p>ValueError: mode is not one of 'recursive', 'parallel', 'hard'.
