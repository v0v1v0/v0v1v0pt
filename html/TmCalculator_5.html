<h2>Calculate G and C content of nucleotide sequences</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculate G and C content of nucleotide sequences. The number of G and C in sequence is divided by length of sequence(when totalnt is TRUE) or the number of all A,T,C,G and ambiguous base.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">GC(ntseq, ambiguous = FALSE, totalnt = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ntseq</code></td>
<td>
<p>Sequence (5' to 3') of one strand of the nucleic acid duplex as string or vector of characters.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ambiguous</code></td>
<td>
<p>Ambiguous bases are taken into account to compute the G and C content when ambiguous is TRUE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>totalnt</code></td>
<td>
<p>Sum of 'G' and 'C' bases divided by the length of the sequence when totalnt is TRUE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Content of G and C(range from 0 to 100
</p>
