<h2>
Completely Randomized Design (CRD)
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The experiment consists of 16 treatments (cultivars) of sorghum conducted in a 
balanced squared lattice design and the yield by plot (kg/plot).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">  data(sorghum)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>An incomplete balanced block design with 4 blocks, 16 treatments, 
and 5 repetitions, that is, the yield of each treatment is measured 5 times.
<code>sorghum</code> is a list with 4 elements. The first ‘<span class="samp">⁠x⁠</span>’ is a factor of lenght 80
with 16 levels describing the treatments. The second ‘<span class="samp">⁠dm⁠</span>’ is data.frame 
describing the design matrix. Its columns are ‘<span class="samp">⁠x⁠</span>’, ‘<span class="samp">⁠bl⁠</span>’ (blocks) and ‘<span class="samp">⁠r⁠</span>’ 
repetitions. The third ‘<span class="samp">⁠y⁠</span>’ is a numeric vector the yields. The fourth ‘<span class="samp">⁠dfm⁠</span>’ 
is a data frame with four columns. The first tree columns are the design matrix
and the fourth is ‘<span class="samp">⁠y⁠</span>’.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The experiment was conducted at EMBRAPA Milho e Sorgo 
(The Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation, Corn and Sorghum section).
