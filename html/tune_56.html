<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Control aspects of the Bayesian search process
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">control_bayes(
  verbose = FALSE,
  verbose_iter = FALSE,
  no_improve = 10L,
  uncertain = Inf,
  seed = sample.int(10^5, 1),
  extract = NULL,
  save_pred = FALSE,
  time_limit = NA,
  pkgs = NULL,
  save_workflow = FALSE,
  save_gp_scoring = FALSE,
  event_level = "first",
  parallel_over = NULL,
  backend_options = NULL,
  allow_par = TRUE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical for logging results (other than warnings and errors,
which are always shown) as they are generated during training in a single
R process. When using most parallel backends, this argument typically will
not result in any logging. If using a dark IDE theme, some logging messages
might be hard to see; try setting the <code>tidymodels.dark</code> option with
<code>options(tidymodels.dark = TRUE)</code> to print lighter colors.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>verbose_iter</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical for logging results of the Bayesian search
process. Defaults to FALSE. If using a dark IDE theme, some logging
messages might be hard to see; try setting the <code>tidymodels.dark</code> option
with <code>options(tidymodels.dark = TRUE)</code> to print lighter colors.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>no_improve</code></td>
<td>
<p>The integer cutoff for the number of iterations without
better results.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>uncertain</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of iterations with no improvement before an
uncertainty sample is created where a sample with high predicted variance is
chosen (i.e., in a region that has not yet been explored). The iteration
counter is reset after each uncertainty sample. For example, if <code>uncertain = 10</code>, this condition is triggered every 10 samples with no improvement.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>seed</code></td>
<td>
<p>An integer for controlling the random number stream. Tuning
functions are sensitive to both the state of RNG set outside of tuning
functions with <code>set.seed()</code> as well as the value set here. The value of the
former determines RNG for the higher-level tuning process, like grid
generation and setting the value of this argument if left as default. The
value of this argument determines RNG state in workers for each iteration
of model fitting, determined by the value of <code>parallel_over</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>extract</code></td>
<td>
<p>An optional function with at least one argument (or <code>NULL</code>)
that can be used to retain arbitrary objects from the model fit object,
recipe, or other elements of the workflow.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>save_pred</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical for whether the out-of-sample predictions should
be saved for each model <em>evaluated</em>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>time_limit</code></td>
<td>
<p>A number for the minimum number of <em>minutes</em> (elapsed) that
the function should execute. The elapsed time is evaluated at internal
checkpoints and, if over time, the results at that time are returned (with
a warning). This means that the <code>time_limit</code> is not an exact limit, but a
minimum time limit.
</p>
<p>Note that timing begins immediately on execution. Thus, if the
<code>initial</code> argument to <code>tune_bayes()</code> is supplied as a number, the elapsed
time will include the time needed to generate initialization results.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pkgs</code></td>
<td>
<p>An optional character string of R package names that should be
loaded (by namespace) during parallel processing.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>save_workflow</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical for whether the workflow should be appended
to the output as an attribute.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>save_gp_scoring</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical to save the intermediate Gaussian process
models for each iteration of the search. These are saved to
<code>tempdir()</code> with names <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠gp_candidates_{i}.RData⁠</code> where <code>i</code> is the iteration.
These results are deleted when the R session ends. This option is only
useful for teaching purposes.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>event_level</code></td>
<td>
<p>A single string containing either <code>"first"</code> or <code>"second"</code>.
This argument is passed on to yardstick metric functions when any type
of class prediction is made, and specifies which level of the outcome
is considered the "event".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>parallel_over</code></td>
<td>
<p>A single string containing either <code>"resamples"</code> or
<code>"everything"</code> describing how to use parallel processing. Alternatively,
<code>NULL</code> is allowed, which chooses between <code>"resamples"</code> and <code>"everything"</code>
automatically.
</p>
<p>If <code>"resamples"</code>, then tuning will be performed in parallel over resamples
alone. Within each resample, the preprocessor (i.e. recipe or formula) is
processed once, and is then reused across all models that need to be fit.
</p>
<p>If <code>"everything"</code>, then tuning will be performed in parallel at two levels.
An outer parallel loop will iterate over resamples. Additionally, an
inner parallel loop will iterate over all unique combinations of
preprocessor and model tuning parameters for that specific resample. This
will result in the preprocessor being re-processed multiple times, but
can be faster if that processing is extremely fast.
</p>
<p>If <code>NULL</code>, chooses <code>"resamples"</code> if there are more than one resample,
otherwise chooses <code>"everything"</code> to attempt to maximize core utilization.
</p>
<p>Note that switching between <code>parallel_over</code> strategies is not guaranteed
to use the same random number generation schemes. However, re-tuning a
model using the same <code>parallel_over</code> strategy is guaranteed to be
reproducible between runs.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>backend_options</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of class <code>"tune_backend_options"</code> as created
by <code>tune::new_backend_options()</code>, used to pass arguments to specific tuning
backend. Defaults to <code>NULL</code> for default backend options.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>allow_par</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical to allow parallel processing (if a parallel
backend is registered).</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For <code>extract</code>, this function can be used to output the model object, the
recipe (if used), or some components of either or both. When evaluated, the
function's sole argument has a fitted workflow If the formula method is used,
the recipe element will be <code>NULL</code>.
</p>
<p>The results of the <code>extract</code> function are added to a list column in the
output called <code>.extracts</code>. Each element of this list is a tibble with tuning
parameter column and a list column (also called <code>.extracts</code>) that contains
the results of the function. If no extraction function is used, there is no
<code>.extracts</code> column in the resulting object. See <code>tune_bayes()</code> for more
specific details.
</p>
<p>Note that for <code>collect_predictions()</code>, it is possible that each row of the
original data point might be represented multiple times per tuning
parameter. For example, if the bootstrap or repeated cross-validation are
used, there will be multiple rows since the sample data point has been
evaluated multiple times. This may cause issues when merging the predictions
with the original data.
</p>


<h3>Hyperparameters and extracted objects</h3>

<p>When making use of submodels, tune can generate predictions and calculate
metrics for multiple model <code>.config</code>urations using only one model fit.
However, this means that if a function was supplied to a
control function's <code>extract</code> argument, tune can only
execute that extraction on the one model that was fitted. As a result,
in the <code>collect_extracts()</code> output, tune opts to associate the
extracted objects with the hyperparameter combination used to
fit that one model workflow, rather than the hyperparameter
combination of a submodel. In the output, this appears like
a hyperparameter entry is recycled across many <code>.config</code>
entries—this is intentional.
