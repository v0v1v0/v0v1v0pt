<h2>List of level 1 single-concentration normalization functions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>sc1_mthds</code> returns a list of functions to be used during level 1 
single-concentration processing.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">sc1_mthds()
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The functions contained in the list returned by <code>sc1_mthds</code> return
a list of expressions to be executed in the <code>sc2</code> (not exported) 
function environment. The functions are described here for reference 
purposes, The <code>sc1_mthds</code> function is not exported, nor is it 
intended for use.
</p>
<p>All available methods are described in the Available Methods section, listed
by the function/method name.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list functions
</p>


<h3>Available Methods</h3>

<p>The methods are broken into three types, based on what fields they define. 
Different methods are used to define "bval" (the baseline value), "pval"
(the positive control value), and "resp" (the final response value). 
</p>
<p>Although it does not say so specifically in each description, all methods 
are applied by acid.
</p>
<p>More information about the level 3 single-concentration processing is 
available in the package vignette, "Data_processing."
</p>

gain-of-signal positive control wells (wllt = p).</p>
</dd>
<dt>pval.apid.mwlls.med</dt>

median, by assay plate ID (apid), of the raw values (rval) for multiple-concentration 
loss-of-signal negative control wells (wllt = m).</p>
</dd>
<dt>pval.apid.medpcbyconc.max</dt>
<dd>
<p>Calculate the positive control value (pval) as the 
plate-wise maximum, by assay plate ID (apid), of the medians of the raw values (rval) for 
gain-of-signal single- or multiple-concentration positive control wells (wllt = p or c) by 
apid, well type, and concentration.</p>
</dd>
<dt>pval.apid.medpcbyconc.min</dt>
<dd>

<dt>pval.apid.medncbyconc.min</dt>
<dd>
<p>Calculate the positive control value (pval) as the 
plate-wise minimum, by assay plate ID (apid), of the medians of the raw values (rval) for 
gain-of-signal single- or multiple-concentration negative control wells (wllt = m or o) by 
apid, well type, and concentration.</p>
</dd>
<dt>pval.zero</dt>
<dd>
<p>Set the positive control value (pval) to 0; pval = 0.</p>
</dd>
<dt>pval.apid.or.aeid.pwlls.med</dt>
<dd>
<p>Calculate the positive control value (pval) as the 
plate-wise median, by assay plate ID (apid), of the raw values (rval) for 
single-concentration gain-of-signal positive control wells (wllt = p). For plates without p 
wells, set the pval as the median pval calculated from all plates.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h4>resp Methods</h4>


<dl>
<dt>resp.pc</dt>
<dd>
<p>Calculate the normalized response (resp) as a percent of control, i.e. the 
ratio of the difference between the raw (rval) and baseline (bval) values divided by the 
difference between positive control (pval) and baseline (bval) values multiplied by 100; 
<code class="reqn">resp=(rval-bval)/(pval-bval)*100</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>resp.fc</dt>
<dd>
<p>Calculate the normalized response (resp) as fold change, i.e. the ratio of 
the raw (rval) and baseline (bval) values; <code class="reqn">resp = rval/bval</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>resp.logfc</dt>
<dd>

<dt>resp.log2</dt>
<dd>
<p>Transform the response values to log-scale (base 2).</p>
</dd>
<dt>resp.multneg1</dt>

<code class="reqn">-1*resp</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>none</dt>
<dd>
<p>Use raw value (rval) as is. This may be necessary for additional 
endpoint-specific adjustments, or where no additional sc1 methods are needed.</p>
</dd>
<dt>resp.incr.zerocenter.fc</dt>
<dd>
<p>Calculate the normalized response (resp) as a zero center 
fold change, i.e. the ratio of the raw (rval) and baseline (bval) values minus 1;
