<h2>Data Twinning</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An efficient implementation of the twinning algorithm proposed in Vakayil and Joseph (2022) for partitioning a dataset into statistically similar twin sets. It is orders of magnitude faster than the SPlit algorithm proposed in Joseph and Vakayil (2021) for splitting a dataset into training and testing sets, and the support points algorithm of Mak and Joseph (2018) for subsampling from Big Data.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The package provides functions <code>twin()</code>, <code>multiplet()</code>, and <code>energy()</code>. <code>twin()</code> partitions datasets into statistically similar disjoint sets, termed as <em>twins</em>. The twins themselves are statistically similar to the original dataset (Vakayil and Joseph, 2022). Such a partition can be employed for optimal training and testing of statistical and machine learning models (Joseph and Vakayil, 2021). The twins can be of unequal size; for tractable model building on large datasets, the smaller twin can serve as a compressed (lossy) version of the original dataset. <code>multiplet()</code> is an extension of <code>twin()</code> to generate multiple disjoint partitions that can be used for <em>k</em>-fold cross validation, or with divide-and-conquer procedures. <code>energy()</code> computes the energy distance (Székely and Rizzo, 2013) between a given dataset and a set of points, which is the metric minimized by twinning.
