<h2>Temperatures of the EUNITE Competition</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The EUNITE Competition dataset composed of a univariate time series of
average daily temperatures measured between 1995 and 1998.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">EUNITE.Temp
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 1461 observations on the following variable.
</p>
 <dl>
<dt>Temperature</dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector with average daily
temperatures measured in the period 1995-1998.</p>
</dd> </dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The EUNITE Competition proposed the prediction of maximum daily electrical
loads based on half-an-hour loads (<code>EUNITE.Loads</code>) and average
daily temperatures of 1997-1998, where the latter is used as a regressor.
Competitors were asked to predict the 31 values corresponding to the daily
maximum electrical loads of January 1999 (<code>EUNITE.Loads.cont</code>).
For the posed prediction problem, the average daily temperatures of January
1999 must also be predicted and for that, the use of data on average daily
temperatures of 1995-1996 was allowed.
