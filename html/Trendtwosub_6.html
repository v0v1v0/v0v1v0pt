<h3>Description</h3>

<p>seedwt.multi.subsample dataset
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">seedwt.multi.subsample
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>data.frame</code> with 2916 rows and 10 columns.</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>multiple maize inbreds were exposed to all combinations of the following stressors: drought, nitrogen, and density stress. Plants were grown in an experimental plot divided into eight sections, and each of the sections received a combination of between zero and three of the stresses previously mentioned, so that all possible stress combinations were included. More details about the experiment can be found in the references
