<h2>A two-sample test for the equality of distributions for high-dimensional data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package implements four different tests proposed in Cousido-Rocha et al. (2018). These methods
test the (global) null hypothesis of equality of the univariate marginals of the p-variate distributions in
the two populations. In other words, the null hypothesis is an intersection of the p null hypotheses
corresponding to p different two-sample problems. These methods are particularly well suited to the low
sample size, high dimensional setting (n &lt;&lt; p). The sample size can be as small as 2. The test accounts
for the possibility that the p variables in each data set can be weakly dependent. Three of the methods
arise from different approaches to estimate the variance of the same statistic. This statistic averages p
individual statistics based on comparing the empirical characteristic functions computed from the two
samples. The last method is an alternative global test whose statistic averages the p-values derived from
applying permutation tests to the individual statistics mentioned above. When the global null hypothesis
is rejected such permutation p-values can also be used to identify which variables contribute to this
significance. The standardized version of each test statistic and its p-value are computed among other
things.
