<h2>tracenma: Database for Developing Transitivity Methodology in Network Meta-Analysis</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A database with extracted study-level aggregate characteristics (that may
act as effect modifiers) from 217 systematic reviews with network
meta-analysis and a set of functions to facilitate access. The database is
aimed at methodology development and appraisal to assess transitivity
assumption quantitatively.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>R-package <b>tracenma</b> is built upon the R-package
<a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=nmadb">nmadb</a> (version 1.2.0) by
using the provided database to define the set of connected networks and
extract available study-level aggregate clinical and methodological
characteristics (that may act as effect modifiers) from the corresponding
systematic reviews. The database of <b>tracenma</b> currently includes a
subset of the systematic reviews available in
<a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=nmadb">nmadb</a>; the included
systematic reviews were published between 2004 and 2015 and had available
data characteristics for extraction.
</p>
<p><b>tracenma</b> comprises functions to access the catalogue with the
available systematic reviews with network meta-analysis and datasets with
the extracted characteristics.
</p>
<p><b>tracenma</b> should only be used for the purpose of developing and
appraising methodology to assess the transitivity assumption
quantitatively. <b>tracenma</b> should <b>not be used</b> in the context of
an empirical-like study, for instance, to map the characteristics reported
in specific healthcare fields, as the content and completeness of the
extracted characteristics in <b>tracenma</b> strongly depend on the
reporting quality and completeness of the considered systematic reviews,
as well as the knowledge of the involved authors regarding the investigated
research field. The latter also requires that the authors of systematic
reviews are familiar with the notion of effect modification. Therefore, the
extracted characteristics may not comprise a complete set of the
necessary effect modifiers for the various investigated research fields.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, most of the included systematic reviews reported the
characteristics inconsistently across the studies. To achieve a
consistent format, we proceeded to transformations using 1) the statistical
methods that Wan et al. (2014) developed and evaluated for quantitative
characteristics and 2) subjective judgments for qualitative
characteristics. Therefore, the accuracy of the extracted data may have
been compromised to some extent.
