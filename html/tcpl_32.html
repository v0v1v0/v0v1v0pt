available in the package vignette, "Data_processing."
</p>

<dl>
<dt>modl.directionality.fail</dt>
<dd>
<p>Flag series if model directionality is questionable, i.e. if 
the winning model direction was opposite, more responses (resp) would have exceeded the cutoff 
(coff). If loss was winning directionality (top &lt; 0), flag if 
<code class="reqn">count(resp&lt;-1*coff)&lt;2*count(resp&gt;coff)</code>. 
If gain was winning directionality (top &gt; 0), flag if 
<code class="reqn">count(resp&gt;coff)&lt;2*count(resp&lt;-1*coff)</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>low.nrep</dt>
<dd>
<p>Flag series if the average number of replicates per concentration is less than 
2; <code class="reqn">nrep &lt; 2</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>low.nconc</dt>
<dd>
<p>Flag series if 4 concentrations or less were tested; <code class="reqn">nconc&lt;=4</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>bmd.high</dt>
<dd>
<p>Flag series if modeled benchmark dose (BMD) is greater than AC50 
(concentration at 50 percent maximal response). This is indicates high variability in baseline 
response in excess of more than half of the maximal response.</p>
</dd>
<dt>singlept.hit.high</dt>
<dd>
<p>Flag single-point hit that's only at the highest conc tested, where 
series is an active hit call (hitc &gt;= 0.9) with the median response observed above baseline 
occurring only at the highest tested concentration tested.</p>
</dd>
<dt>singlept.hit.mid</dt>
<dd>
<p>Flag single-point hit that's not at the highest conc tested, where 
series is an active hit call (hitc &gt;= 0.9) with the median response observed above baseline 
occurring only at one concentration and not the highest concentration tested.</p>
</dd>
<dt>multipoint.neg</dt>
<dd>
<p>Flag multi-point miss, where series is an inactive hit call (hitc &lt; 0.9) 
with multiple median responses observed above baseline.</p>
</dd>
<dt>gnls.lowconc</dt>
<dd>
<p>Flag series where winning model is gain-loss (gnls) and the gain AC50 is 
less than the minimum tested concentration, and the loss AC50 is less than the mean tested 
concentration.</p>
</dd>
<dt>noise</dt>
<dd>
<p>Flag series as noisy if the quality of fit as calculated by the root mean square 
error (rmse) for the series is greater than the cutoff (coff); <code class="reqn">rmse &gt; coff</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>border</dt>
<dd>
<p>Flag series if borderline activity is suspected based on modeled top parameter 
(top) relative to cutoff (coff); <code class="reqn">|top|&lt;=1.2*coff~or~|top|&gt;=0.8*coff</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>overfit.hit</dt>
<dd>
<p>Method not yet updated for tcpl implementation. Flag hit-calls that would 
get changed after doing the small N correction to the aic values.</p>
</dd>
<dt>efficacy.50</dt>
<dd>
<p>Flag low efficacy hits if series has an active hit call (hitc &gt;= 0.9) and 
efficacy values (e.g. top and maximum median response) less than 50 percent; intended for 
biochemical assays. If <code class="reqn">hitc&gt;=0.9</code> and <code class="reqn">coff&gt;=5</code>, then flag when 
<code class="reqn">top&lt;50</code> or <code class="reqn">maxmed &lt; 50</code>. If <code class="reqn">hitc&gt;=0.9</code> and 
<code class="reqn">coff&lt;5</code>, then flag when <code class="reqn">top&lt;\log_{2}{1.5}</code> or 
<code class="reqn">maxmed&lt;\log_{2}{1.5}</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>ac50.lowconc</dt>
<dd>
<p>Flag series with an active hit call (hitc &gt;= 0.9) if AC50 (concentration 
at 50 percent maximal response) is less than the lowest concentration tested; if 
<code class="reqn">hitc&gt;=0.9</code> and <code class="reqn">ac50&lt;10^{log_{c}{min}}</code>, then flag.</p>
</dd>
<dt>viability.gnls</dt>
<dd>
<p>Flag series with an active hit call (hitc &gt;= 0.9) if denoted as cell 
viability assay with winning model is gain-loss (gnls); if hitc &gt;= 0.9, modl = "gnls" and 
cell_viability_assay = 1, then flag.</p>
</dd>
<dt>no.med.gt.3bmad</dt>
<dd>
<p>Flag series where no median response values are greater than baseline as 
defined by 3 times the baseline median absolute deviation (bmad); nmed_gtbl_pos and
nmed_gtbl_neg both = 0, where nmed_gtbl_pos/_neg is the number of medians greater than 3 * 
bmad/less than -3 * bmad.</p>
