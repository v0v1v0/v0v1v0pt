<h2>Remove cuts from your tree. This is, e.g., useful if you would like to
remove certain chapters from the ICD-10 tree used for the analysis as some
chapters might be a prior deemed irrelevant for the exposure of interest,
e.g., chapter 20 (external causes of death) might not be of interest
when comparing two drug exposures.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Remove cuts from your tree. This is, e.g., useful if you would like to
remove certain chapters from the ICD-10 tree used for the analysis as some
chapters might be a prior deemed irrelevant for the exposure of interest,
e.g., chapter 20 (external causes of death) might not be of interest
when comparing two drug exposures.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">drop_cuts(tree, cuts, delimiter = "/", return_removed = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tree</code></td>
<td>
<p>A dataset with one variable <code>pathString</code> defining the tree structure
that you would like to use. This dataset can, e.g., be created using
<code>create_tree</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cuts</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector of cuts to remove. Please make sure that your string
uniquely identifies the cut that should be removed. Each string is passed
to <code>base::gsub()</code> to identify the cuts that should be removed. Hence, strings
can include regular expressions for identifying cuts. If you would like to
remove a cut on the top level of the hierarchy, it might be helpful to use
the regular expression operator <code>^</code>.
</p>
<p>Regular expression are composed as follows:
<code>paste0(cuts, delimiter, "?(.*)")</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>delimiter</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character defining the delimiter of different tree levels within your
<code>pathString</code>. The default is <code>/</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>return_removed</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical value for indicating whether you would like to get a list of
removed cuts returned by the function.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>If <code>return_removed = FALSE</code> a data.frame with a single variable named
<code>pathString</code> is returned, which includes the updated tree. If
<code>return_removed = TRUE</code> a list with two elements is return:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>tree</dt>
<dd>
<p>The updated tree file</p>
</dd>
<dt>removed</dt>
<dd>
<p>A list of character vectors including the paths that
have been removed from the supplied tree. The list is named using the
cuts supplied to <code>cut</code>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">drop_cuts(icd_10_se, c("B35-B49", "F41")) |&gt;
   head()

</code></pre>
