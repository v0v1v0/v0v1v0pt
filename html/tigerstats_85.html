<h2>Effect of Soil Salinity on Plant Growth</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Result of an experiment conducted to investigate the effect of salinity level in soil 
on the growth of plants.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 24 observations on the following 3 variables.
</p>
 <dl>
<dt>salt</dt>
<dd>
<p>amount of salt applied to the plot (in parts per million)</p>
</dd>
<dt>biomass</dt>
<dd>
<p>total biomass of plot at the end of the study period (units unknown)</p>
</dd>
<dt>block</dt>
<dd>
<p>field in which the plot was located</p>
</dd> </dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>From the source (see below):  "Experimental
fields of land were located at an agricultural field station, and each field was divided into six smaller
plots. Each of the smaller plots was treated with a different amount of salt (measured in ppm) and the
biomass at the end of the experiment was recorded."
