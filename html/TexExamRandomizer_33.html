<h2>Subsetting Document</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>If you use a function such as A[vector], it only preserves the names attribute, it doesn't preserve any other attribute. This Function attempts to "fix" that manually, for lack of a better solution, instead of using S3 classes. Therefore, it can be used with other documents.
</p>
<p>It subsets the attributes that have the same length as the Document itself and preserve all other attributes with length 0
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">SubsetWithAtributes(Document, vector)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Document</code></td>
<td>
<p>Document that we want to subset</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>vector</code></td>
<td>
<p>The vector that provides the subsetting, like <code>`[`</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Although this function was created with documents in mind, it can work with any R array that holds attributes and has a subsetting <code>`[`</code> function call.
