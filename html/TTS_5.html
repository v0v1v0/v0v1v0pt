<h2>Dataset obtained from creep tests of styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS)
composite by using Dynamic Mechanical Thermal Analysis (DMTA)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>SBS is a dataset composed of 195 rows and 3 columns that describes the
performance in the framework of a creep test of a styrene-butadiene-styrene
(SBS) composite. The creep tests are defined by the application of a
constant stress, <code class="reqn">\sigma</code>, and the measuring of the strain, <code class="reqn">\varepsilon (t)</code>, 
or compliance, <code class="reqn">J(t)= \varepsilon (t) / \sigma</code> (in the present case), as 
the response variable. The
experimental tests are made by Dynamic Mechanical Thermal Analysis (DMTA)
technique, using a 3 point bending configuration with the following
features: Clamp, 3-Point Bending; Geometry, Rectangular; Size: length of 20
mm, width of 5.54 mm, and thickness of about 3.87 mmm.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>This data frame is composed of the following columns: 
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Log10_time</dt>
<dd>
<p>It accounts for 39 different times from 2 s to
3600 s, in logarithmic scale for each one of the 5 studied temperatures
(overall 195 observations).</p>
</dd> 
<dt>Log10_Compliance</dt>
<dd>
<p>It accounts for
39 different values for the compliance, J (MPa-1), for each one of the 5
studied temperatures, in base-ten logarithmic scale.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Temperature</dt>
<dd>
<p>It is the variable that shows the temperature at
which the measurements of compliance are experimentally obtained, namely 40,
50, 60, 70, and 80 Celsius degrees.</p>
</dd> </dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The dataset corresponds to the measure of the compliance property (with
respect to the time) of different specimens of a SBS composite. The
measurements were obtained by DMTA experimental technique.

<p>The application of the TTS principle to creep tests is becoming more and
more common. Creep test provides information about the deformation of a
material subjected to a constant load. This test is in accordance with many
real applications such as the performance of shoe insoles, structural
materials, asphalt, etc. In this framework, TTS provides the degree of the
deformation of the material at an extended range of times, when this
material is subjected to a constant load. Therefore, TTS is becoming
increasingly useful in studies of material degradation and lifetime
estimation. The use of the TTS principle with creep tests usually provides
smoother master curves since each curve is usually defined by a larger
number of experimental observations than, for example, modulus curves as a
function of frequency.
