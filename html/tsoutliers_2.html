<h2>Calendar Effects</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function creates regressor variables for trading day, Easter and leap year effects 
over the sample period where the input time series is sampled.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">calendar.effects(x, trading.day = TRUE, easter = 6, 
  leap.year = FALSE, holidays = NULL, easter.date = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>a monthly time series.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>trading.day</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical. If <code>TRUE</code>, trading day regressor variable is returned.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>easter</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric. The number of days before Easter over which the Easter effect spans. 
If it is set to zero Easter variable is not returned.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>leap.year</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical. If <code>TRUE</code>, leap year regressor variable is returned.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>holidays</code></td>
<td>
<p>an optional numeric vector of the same length as <code>x</code> containing 
the number of holidays for each time period.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>easter.date</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical indicating whether the date of Easter should be returned.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Let <code class="reqn">wd</code> be the number of working days in a given month 
and <code class="reqn">nwd</code> the number of non-working days.
The trading day variable at time <code class="reqn">t</code> is built as follows:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">wd = wd - holidays</code>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">nwd = nwd + holidays</code>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">td_t = wd - (5/2) \times nwd</code>
</p>

<p>By default, working days are the days from Monday to Friday and 
non-working days are Saturdays and Sundays. If there are additional 
non-working days they can be defined in argument <code>holidays</code>. 
For example, if the 1st of February is a local holiday, the user can define 
a variable containing zeros for all periods except for the periods related 
to February where the 1st of February falls within a working day (Monday to Friday); 
these data are set to one so that they are considered as non working days.
</p>
<p>Easter effect is defined as the proportion of days before Easter 
(by default <code>easter = 6</code>) that lie in March and April, 
respectively for each month. It contains zeros for the remaining months.
</p>
<p>The leap year is a vector of zeros for all months except February, 
where the variable takes on the value <code class="reqn">0.75</code> if the year is a leap year
and <code class="reqn">-0.25</code> otherwise.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A <code>mts</code> matrix containing the selected calendar effects by columns.
</p>
<p>If <code>easter.date</code> is <code>TRUE</code> a list is returned containing the 
<code>mts</code> matrix of calendar effects as well as the dates of Easter for 
each year of the sample.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># display calendar effects for a sample span period
# no data are actually necessary in the input series 
# since calendar effects are concerned only with the dates
# at which the data are sampled
x &lt;- ts(frequency = 12, start = c(1980, 1), end = c(2000, 12))
ce &lt;- calendar.effects(x, leap.year = TRUE)
colnames(ce)
plot(ce, main = "calendar effects")
# Easter days for each year
calendar.effects(x, easter.date = TRUE)$easter
</code></pre>
