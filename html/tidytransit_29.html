<h2>Calculate travel times from one stop to all reachable stops</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>raptor</code> finds the minimal travel time, earliest or latest arrival time for all
stops in <code>stop_times</code> with journeys departing from <code>stop_ids</code> within
<code>time_range</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">raptor(
  stop_times,
  transfers,
  stop_ids,
  arrival = FALSE,
  time_range = 3600,
  max_transfers = NULL,
  keep = "all"
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>stop_times</code></td>
<td>
<p>A (prepared) stop_times table from a gtfs feed. Prepared means
that all stop time rows before the desired journey departure time
should be removed. The table should also only include departures
happening on one day. Use <code>filter_stop_times()</code> for easier preparation.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>transfers</code></td>
<td>
<p>Transfers table from a gtfs feed. In general no preparation
is needed. Can be omitted if stop_times has been prepared with
<code>filter_stop_times()</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>stop_ids</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character vector with stop_ids from where journeys should start (or end).
It is recommended to only use stop_ids that are related to each other,
like different platforms in a train station or bus stops that are
reasonably close to each other.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>arrival</code></td>
<td>
<p>If FALSE (default), all journeys <em>start</em> from <code>stop_ids</code>. If
TRUE, all journeys <em>end</em> at <code>stop_ids</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>time_range</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either a range in seconds or a vector containing the
minimal and maximal departure time (i.e. earliest and
latest possible journey departure time) as seconds or
"HH:MM:SS" character.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>max_transfers</code></td>
<td>
<p>Maximum number of transfers allowed, no limit (NULL) as default.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>keep</code></td>
<td>
<p>One of c("all", "shortest", "earliest", "latest"). By default, <code>all</code> journeys
between stop_ids are returned. With <code>shortest</code> only the journey with shortest
travel time is returned. With <code>earliest</code> the journey arriving at a stop the
earliest is returned, <code>latest</code> works accordingly.
</p>
<p>All departures from <code>stop_ids</code> within
the time range stop_id in
<code>stop_ids</code>) within <code>time_range</code> are considered. If <code>arrival</code> is TRUE,
all arrivals within <code>time_range</code> before the latest arrival time of
stop_times are considered.</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>With a modified <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/round-based-public-transit-routing/">Round-Based Public Transit Routing Algorithm</a>
(RAPTOR) using data.table, earliest arrival times for all stops are calculated. If two
journeys arrive at the same time, the one with the later departure time and thus shorter
travel time is kept. By default, all journeys departing within <code>time_range</code> that arrive
at a stop are returned in a table. If you want all journeys <em>arriving</em> at stop_ids within
the specified time range, set <code>arrival</code> to TRUE.
</p>
<p>Journeys are defined by a "from" and "to" stop_id, a departure, arrival and travel time.
Note that the exact journeys (with each intermediate stop and route ids for example) is
<em>not</em> returned.
</p>
<p>For most cases, <code>stop_times</code> needs to be filtered, as it should only contain trips
happening on a single day, see <code>filter_stop_times()</code>. The algorithm scans all trips
until it exceeds <code>max_transfers</code> or all trips in <code>stop_times</code> have been visited.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data.table with journeys (departure, arrival and travel time) to/from all
stop_ids reachable by <code>stop_ids</code>.
</p>


<h3>See Also</h3>

<p><code>travel_times()</code> for an easier access to travel time calculations via stop_names.
</p>
