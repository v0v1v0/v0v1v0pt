<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Note: This alternate specification wrapper is not receiving further support
and will be removed in a future version of <code>tabr</code>.
</p>
<p>This alternate syntax allows for specifying string/fret combinations instead
of unambiguous pitch as is used by <code>phrase()</code>. In order to remove ambiguity,
it is critical to specify the instrument string tuning and key signature. It
essentially uses <code>string</code> and <code>fret</code> in combination with a known tuning and
key signature to generate <code>notes</code> for <code>phrase()</code>. <code>info</code> is passed straight
through to <code>phrase()</code>, as is <code>string</code> once it is done being used to help
derive <code>notes</code>.
</p>
<p>See the main function <code>phrase</code> for general details on phrase
construction.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a phrase.
</p>


<h3>Comparison with <code>phrase()</code>
</h3>

<p>This function is a wrapper function for users not working with musical notes
(what to play), but rather just position on the guitar neck (where to play).
This approach has conveniences, but is more limiting.
In order to remove ambiguity, it is necessary to specify the instrument
<code>tuning</code> and the <code>key</code> signature.
</p>
<p>In the standard approach with <code>phrase()</code> you specify what to play;
specifying exactly where to play is optional, but highly recommended (by
providing <code>string</code>).
With <code>sf_phrase()</code>, the <code>string</code> argument is of course required along with
<code>fret</code>.
But any time the tuning changes, this "where to play" method breaks down and
must be redone. It is more robust to provide the string and pitch rather
than the string and fret.
The <code>key</code> is additionally important because it is the only way to
indicate if accidentals should be notated as sharps or flats.
</p>
<p>This wrapper also increases redundancy and typing. In order to specify rests
<code>r</code>, silent rests <code>s</code>, and tied notes <code>~</code>, these must now be providing in
parallel in both the <code>string</code> and <code>fret</code> arguments, whereas in the standard
method using <code>phrase()</code>, they need only be provided once to <code>notes</code>.
A mismatch will throw an error. Despite the redundancy, this is helpful for
ensuring proper match up between <code>string</code> and <code>fret</code>, which is essentially a
dual entry method that aims to reduce itself inside <code>sf_phrase()</code> to a single
<code>notes</code> string that is passed internally to <code>phrase()</code>.
</p>
<p>The important thing to keep in mind is that by its nature, this method of
writing out music does not lend itself well to high detail.
Tabs that are informed by nothing but string and fret number remove a lot of
important information, and those that attempt to compensate with additional
symbols in say, an ascii tab, are difficult to read.
This wrapper function providing this alternative input method to
<code>phrase()</code> does its job of allowing users to create phrase objects that
are equivalent to standard <code>phrase()</code>-generated objects, including rests
and ties.
But practice and comfort working with <code>phrase()</code> is is highly recommended
for greater control of development support.
</p>
<p>The function <code>sfp()</code> is a convenient shorthand wrapper for <code>sf_phrase()</code>.
<code>sf_note()</code> and the alias <code>sfn()</code> are wrappers around <code>sf_phrase()</code> that
force <code>to_notes = TRUE</code>.
</p>


<h3>Single-string input</h3>

<p>Another way to use <code>sf_phrase()</code> is to provide all musical input to
<code>string</code> and ignore <code>fret</code> and <code>info</code> as explicit arguments.
Providing all three explicit arguments more closely mimics the inputs of
<code>phrase()</code> and is useful when you have this information as three
independent sources.
However, in some cases the single-argument input method can reduce typing,
though this depends on the phrase.
More importantly, it allow you to reason about your musical inputs by time
step rather than by argument.
If you provide all three components as a single character string to the
<code>string</code> argument, leaving both <code>fret</code> and <code>info</code> as <code>NULL</code>, then
<code>sf_phrase()</code> will decompose <code>string</code> into its three component parts
internally.
</p>
<p>There are some rules for single-argument input. The three components are
separated by semicolons as <code>"string;fret;info"</code>.
For example, <code>"3;7x7;4"</code> means begin on the third string
(infer higher number strings muted).
The frets are 7th and 7th, meaning two notes are played. When an <code>x</code> is
present in the second entry it means a string is not played.
This is how it is inferred that the string numbers starting from the third
string are strings 3 and 1 rather than 3 and 2 in this example.
The 4 indicates a quarter note since it is part of the third entry where the
additional <code>info</code> is specified. This is contextual. For example, an
<code>x</code> here would still indicate a dead note, rather than an unplayed
string in the second entry, so this is contextual.
</p>
<p>A bonus when using this input method is that explicit <code>string</code> and
<code>info</code> values persist from one timestep to the next.
Neither needs to be provided again until there is a change in value.
For example, <code>"3;7x7;4 7x7 ;7x7;1"</code> repeats the string and info values
from timestep one for timestep two.
In timestep three, string numbers repeat again, but the duration changes
from quarter note to whole note.
</p>
<p>Note that except when both <code>string</code> and <code>info</code> are repeating and
only fret numbers are provided (see timestep two above), two semicolons
must be present so that it is unambiguous whether the sole missing component
is a <code>string</code> or <code>info</code> (see timestep three).
</p>
<p>Ambiguity would arise from a case like <code>"4;4"</code> without the second semicolon.
This type of indexing was chosen over using two different delimiters.
</p>
<p>If a rest, <code>r</code> or <code>s</code>, is provided for the <code>fret</code> entry, then the <code>string</code>
entry is ignored. When using this input method, ties <code>~</code> are given in the
info entry.
</p>

both input methods for <code>sf_phrase()</code>.
