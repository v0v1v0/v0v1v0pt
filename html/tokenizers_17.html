<h2>N-gram tokenizers</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These functions tokenize their inputs into different kinds of n-grams. The
input can be a character vector of any length, or a list of character vectors
where each character vector in the list has a length of 1. See details for an
explanation of what each function does.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">tokenize_ngrams(
  x,
  lowercase = TRUE,
  n = 3L,
  n_min = n,
  stopwords = character(),
  ngram_delim = " ",
  simplify = FALSE
)

tokenize_skip_ngrams(
  x,
  lowercase = TRUE,
  n_min = 1,
  n = 3,
  k = 1,
  stopwords = character(),
  simplify = FALSE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector or a list of character vectors to be tokenized
into n-grams. If <code>x</code> is a character vector, it can be of any length,
and each element will be tokenized separately. If <code>x</code> is a list of
character vectors, each element of the list should have a length of 1.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>lowercase</code></td>
<td>
<p>Should the tokens be made lower case?</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of words in the n-gram. This must be an integer greater
than or equal to 1.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n_min</code></td>
<td>
<p>The minimum number of words in the n-gram. This must be an
integer greater than or equal to 1, and less than or equal to <code>n</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>stopwords</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector of stop words to be excluded from the
n-grams.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ngram_delim</code></td>
<td>
<p>The separator between words in an n-gram.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>simplify</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>FALSE</code> by default so that a consistent value is
returned regardless of length of input. If <code>TRUE</code>, then an input with
a single element will return a character vector of tokens instead of a
list.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>k</code></td>
<td>
<p>For the skip n-gram tokenizer, the maximum skip distance between
words. The function will compute all skip n-grams between <code>0</code> and
<code>k</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

 <dl>
<dt>
<code>tokenize_ngrams</code>:</dt>
<dd>
<p> Basic shingled n-grams. A
contiguous subsequence of <code>n</code> words. This will compute shingled n-grams
for every value of between <code>n_min</code> (which must be at least 1) and
<code>n</code>. </p>
</dd> <dt>
<code>tokenize_skip_ngrams</code>:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Skip n-grams. A subsequence
of <code>n</code> words which are at most a gap of <code>k</code> words between them. The
skip n-grams will be calculated for all values from <code>0</code> to <code>k</code>. </p>
</dd> </dl>
<p>These functions will strip all punctuation and normalize all whitespace to a
single space character.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list of character vectors containing the tokens, with one element
in the list for each element that was passed as input. If <code>simplify =
  TRUE</code> and only a single element was passed as input, then the output is a
character vector of tokens.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">song &lt;-  paste0("How many roads must a man walk down\n",
                "Before you call him a man?\n",
                "How many seas must a white dove sail\n",
                "Before she sleeps in the sand?\n",
                "\n",
