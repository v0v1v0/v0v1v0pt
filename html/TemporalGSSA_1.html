<h2>calculate_TemporalGSSA()
This is the main function of the package 'TemporalGSSA'.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>'TemporalGSSA', may be considered a wrapper for the R-package 'GillespieSSA'.
The formatted data generated by consecutive runs of 'GillespieSSA' for molecules of a generic
biochemical network will generate a dataset of randomly chosen timesteps along with changes to the
corresponding number of molecules. This constitutes a set observations for a specific simulation time.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">calculate_TemporalGSSA(data, type, out)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>Formatted data from the output of consecutive 'GillespieSSA' runs.
This is a mandatory argument.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p>A mandatory integer argument that indicates the statistic that will be used
to compute the representative timestep for a set of observations.
Here: "1" is the MEAN, "2" is the MEDIAN, "3" is a random choice and "4" is ALL</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>out</code></td>
<td>
<p>An optional logical argument that control the console output with default being "TRUE"
Here, TRUE curtails the output while FALSE allows the verbose output of all the coefficents .</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The temporal profile of a metabolite is a pre-requisite to comprehend its behaviour in vivo.
</p>
<p>This is accomplished by transforming the raw formatted data into a metabolite-specific trial.
Each such trial is defined as a set of linear models (n &gt;= 30) between a timestep and number of molecules
for a metabolite. The coefficients of these models (slope, constant) are averaged and incorporated into a metabolite-specific
linear regression model. The independent variable is a representative timestep and is user-dependent.
The generated data is an imputed number of molecules for each metabolite, is dependent on the simulation time and
is defined as a "technical replicate".
</p>
<p>The above steps are easily repeated with additional SSA-runs (n &gt;=30) and will generate sets of "technical replicates".
These can be statistically evaluated (mean, standard deviation) and will constitute the simulation time-dependent number of molecules for a particular metabolite.
For varying simulation times 'TemporalGSSA' will generate a metabolite-specific and simulation time-dependent trajectory.
