<h2>Summarize the Results of a Monte Carlo Simulation</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Summarize the results of a Monte Carlo Simulation run by <code>future_mc()</code> with
(optionally) user-defined summary functions.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S3 method for class 'mc'
summary(object, sum_funs = NULL, which_path = "all", ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of class <code>mc</code>,
for which holds <code>simple_output = TRUE</code>.
See value of <code>future_mc()</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sum_funs</code></td>
<td>
<p>A named (nested) list containing summary functions.
See details.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>which_path</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector containing the names of (some of)
the named outputs
(the names of the returned list of <code>fun</code> in <code>future_mc()</code>),
for which to return a "path" of the
stepwise calculation of the result of the summary function.
Alternatively, <code>"all"</code> or <code>"none"</code> can be used to return either
the path for all or none of the
numeric outputs.
Default: <code>"all"</code>.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In order to use <code>summary()</code>,
the output of <code>future_mc()</code> has to be "simple",
which is the case if the return value of <code>fun</code> is a named list of scalars.
If the
returned value of <code>fun</code> is a named list of more complex data structures,
<code>summary()</code>
cannot be used.
</p>
<p>With <code>sum_funs</code> the user can define (different) functions which summarize
the simulation results for each output
(return values of <code>fun</code> in <code>future_mc()</code>)
and each parameter combination.
Thus, the functions inside <code>sum_funs</code> only take one argument,
which is the output vector (with length <code>repetitions</code>) of one output
of one specific parameter combination.
</p>
<p>The default summary functions are <code>base::mean()</code> for numeric outputs and
<code>base::summary()</code> for outputs with non-numeric data types.
</p>
<p>The user can define summary functions by supplying a named
(nested) list to <code>sum_funs</code>. When
the functions provided for each output return only one numeric value
the results are twofold:
first, a single scalar result of the
function evaluating the whole output vector.
Second, a "path" with length <code>repetitions</code> of the
stepwise calculation of the function's result
across the output vector
(assumed that the output is contained in <code>which_path</code>).
</p>
<p>If the user wants to summarize the simulation results of a respective output
in the same way
for each parameter combination, a list whose components are named after the
outputs (the names of the returned
list of <code>fun</code> in <code>future_mc()</code>) is supplied and each component is
a function which only takes the vector of results
of one output as the main argument.
</p>
<p>If the user wants to summarize the simulation
results of a respective output differently for
different parameter combinations, a nested list has to be supplied.
The components of the outer list
must be equal in length and naming to the <code>nice_names</code> of the parameter
combinations (see value of <code>future_mc()</code>) and each component is another
list (inner list). The components of the inner list are then defined the
same way as above
(components named after the outputs and each component is a function).
</p>
<p>The provided summary functions are not restricted regarding the complexity
of their return value.
However, the path of the summarized output over all simulation repetitions
is only returned if the
provided summary functions return a single numeric value
(and the output is contained in <code>which_path</code>).
Thus, <code>plot.summary.mc()</code> will only work in this specific case.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list of type <code>summary.mc</code> containing the
result of the summary functions of the simulation
results of a respective output and parameter combination.
</p>
<p>If the provided summary functions return a single numeric value,
the path of the summarized output
(which are contained in <code>which_path</code>)
over all simulation repetitions is also returned.
</p>
