<h2>SNS Comments data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset of 630 German participants in an online experiment. The experiment
investigated the effects of user comments on social network sites (SNS) on
individuals' perceptions of journalistic quality. The researchers varied the
subject of the article (factor 1: 'Copyright directive' or 'Social housing'),
the order of comment presentation (factor 2: before or after the
article) and the valence of the comments (factor 3: positive or negative).
