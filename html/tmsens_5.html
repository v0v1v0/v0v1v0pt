<h2>Calculating Bias For Trimmed Mean Linear Models:</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>tm_bias</code> calculates the bias and the bias-adjusted estimate for a trimmed means analysis (<code>tm</code>) of a given
dataset, for a user-specified trimming fraction and dropout spread. <code>tm_bias</code> calculates, under assumption
of normally distributed outcomes, the bias components resulting from violation of the
location shift assumption and violation of the strong MNAR assumption.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">tm_bias(
  formula,
  GR,
  trF,
  side = c("LOW", "HIGH"),
  spread_TG = "max_bias",
  spread_CG = "max_bias",
  data
)

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The trimmed means estimate is subject to two assumptions: the strong MNAR assumption requires
that all dropouts (unobserved outcome values) are located in the fraction of the distribution
that is trimmed away; the location shift assumption requires the group variances of the full sample
to be equal. The bias resulting from the violation of either assumption can be calculated under assumption
of normally distributed outcomes.
</p>
<p>Obtaining the strong MNAR assumption bias requires an additional assumption about
the distribution of the dropouts: it is assumed that the dropouts are spread homogeneously across the specified
dropout spread. For example, under lower value trimming (<code>side="LOW"</code>), and a treatment group dropout
spread of 0.6 (<code>spread_TG=0.6</code>), any value in the bottom 60% of the treatment group outcome distribution
is equally likely to be missing.
</p>
<p>The specified dropout spread for a given treatment group has implications for the unobserved full sample
variance that is inferred from the observed data. For example, for an observed dropout of 0.4 and an
assumed dropout spread of 0.5, the inferred full sample variance will be larger than for an assumed
dropout spread of e.g., 0.8.
</p>
<p>In addition to calculating the bias for a user-specified dropout spread, <code>tm_bias</code> also calculates
the maximal bias. For example, for lower value trimming (<code>side="LOW"</code>), the worst-case scenario would
involve lower value dropout in the treatment group (TG) and higher value dropout in the comparator group (CG),
and vice versa. Bias components are calculated for both scenarios. If the dropout spread
(<code>spread_TG</code>, <code>spread_CG</code>) is left unspecified for either treatment group, the function will
return only these quantities.
