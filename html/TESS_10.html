<h2>tess.likelihood.rateshift: Probability density of a tree under a tree-wide time-dependent birth-death-shift process</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>tess.likelihood.rateshift computes the probability of a reconstructed phylogenetic tree under a rate-shift model. The rates are piecewise constant. Additionally, mass-extinction event can be provided and a uniform taxon sampling probability. You have several options for the start of the process (origin vs MRCA) and the condition of the process (time, survival or taxa; note that survival and taxa implicitly condition on the time too!). See equation (5) in the manuscript for more information. Note that constant rates lead to much faster computations.
The likelihood can be computed for incompletely sampled trees. You need to give a sampling probability != 1.0. You have three options for the sampling strategy: uniform|diversified|age. The detailed description of these can be found in the references. More information can be obtained in the vignette about how to apply this likelihood function.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">tess.likelihood.rateshift( times,
				 lambda, 
				 mu, 
				 rateChangeTimesLambda = c(),
				 rateChangeTimesMu = c(),
				 massExtinctionTimes = c(), 
   				 massExtinctionSurvivalProbabilities = c(),
                 missingSpecies = c(),
                 timesMissingSpecies = c(),
				 samplingStrategy = "uniform", 
   				 samplingProbability = 1, 
				 MRCA = TRUE, 
   				 CONDITION = "survival", 
				 log = TRUE)

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># load a test data set
data(cettiidae)

# convert the phylogeny into the branching times
times &lt;- as.numeric( branching.times(cettiidae) )

# construct speciation and extinction rate function that resemble the rate-shift
# any other function could be used too
l &lt;- Vectorize(function(x) { if (x &gt; 0.5 || x &lt; 0.3) { return (1) } else { return (2) } })
e &lt;- Vectorize(function(x) { if (x &gt; 0.5 || x &lt; 0.3) { return (0.95) } else { return (0.5) } })

# now compute the likelihood for the tree
tess.likelihood(times,l,e,MRCA=TRUE,log=TRUE)

# a second approach is the specific episodic birth-death process likelihood function
# we need to give the rates for each episode and the end time of the episodes
# you should see that both are equivalent in this setting
# the function approach is more general but also slower.
tess.likelihood.rateshift(times,
				lambda=c(2,1,2),
				mu=c(0.95,0.5,0.95),
				rateChangeTimesLambda=c(0.3,0.5),
				rateChangeTimesMu=c(0.3,0.5),
				MRCA=TRUE,
