<h2>Fake teacher roster dataset from OpenSDP</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The Fake County synthetic panel dataset contains approximately 40,000 records comprising four years of data with roughly 10,000 teachers per year. The dataset includes information about teacher demographics, teaching assignments, salary, credentials, experience, evaluation scores, and hiring and retention status. It also includes information about school types and average student characteristics for each school. There are no real teachers in the dataset, but it is based on real data. Fake County was developed as an offshoot of the Strategic Data Project's work on human capital diagnostics for school districts and state education departments, and can be used for teaching or collaboration. The data was synthesized using the R synthpop package.
