<h2>Tanaka Contours Package</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The tanaka package is a simplified implementation of the Tanaka method.
Also called "relief contours method", "illuminated contour method", or
"shaded contour lines method", the Tanaka method enhances the representation
of topography on a map using shaded contour lines. North-west white contours
represent illuminated topography and south-east black contours represent
shaded topography.
