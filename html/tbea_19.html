<h2>Frequency of topologies in a tree sample</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Frequency of topologies in a tree sample
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">topoFreq(mphy, output = "index", maxtrees = 10000)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mphy</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of class multiPhylo</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>output</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character indicating whether the tree indices or the actual trees should be returned. Defaults to "index"</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>maxtrees</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric indicating whether to warn about having more trees than the arbitrary threshold</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function can be used e.w. with a posterior sample of trees from a Bayesian analysis where we
want to explore the distribution of topologies in the posterior of trees. This way we can assess topological
uncertainty in a more meaningful way than using a majority-rule consensus.
</p>
<p>The use of 'maxtrees' is actually a convenience for keeping in mind that large amounts of trees can cause memory
issues. This can end up in situations which are difficult to debug but that from personal experience have come from
exactly that: More trees than memory can fit or which can be processed for calculating similarity. This number will _not_
break the function call but will return a warning. Try to avoid modifying its default value unless you are sure it will not
cause any issues under your computing conditions (e.g. when lots of trees are being processed but also large RAM is available).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list with an element containing the the different tree clusters (as multiPhylo)
and the absolute, cumulative, and relative frequencies of each topology in the tree sample.
