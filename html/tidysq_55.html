<h2>Concatenate sq objects</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Merges multiple <code>sq</code> and possibly
<code>character</code> objects into one larger <code>sq</code> object.
</p>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>[<code>sq</code> || <code>character</code>]<br>
Multiple objects. For exact behavior, check Details section. First argument
must be of <code>sq</code> class due to R mechanism of single dispatch. If this is
a problem, recommended alternative is <code>vec_c</code> method from
<code>vctrs-package</code> package.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Whenever all passed objects are of one of standard types (that is,
<strong>dna_bsc</strong>, <strong>dna_ext</strong>, <strong>rna_bsc</strong>, <strong>rna_ext</strong>,
<strong>ami_bsc</strong> or <strong>ami_ext</strong>), returned object is of the same class,
as no changes to alphabet are needed.
</p>
<p>It's possible to mix both basic and extended types within one call to
<code>c()</code>, however they all must be of the same type (that is, either
<strong>dna</strong>, <strong>rna</strong> or <strong>ami</strong>). In this case, returned object
is of extended type.
</p>
<p>Mixing <strong>dna</strong>, <strong>rna</strong> and <strong>ami</strong> types is prohibited, as
interpretation of letters differ depending on the type.
</p>
<p>Whenever all objects are either of <strong>atp</strong> type, returned object is also
of this class and resulting alphabet is equal to set union of all input
alphabets.
</p>
<p><strong>unt</strong> type can be mixed with any other type, resulting in <strong>unt</strong>
object with alphabet equal to set union of all input alphabets. In this case,
it is possible to concatenate <strong>dna</strong> and <strong>ami</strong> objects, for
instance, by concatenating one of them first with <strong>unt</strong> object.
However, it is strongly discouraged, as it may result in unwanted
concatenation of DNA and amino acid sequences.
</p>
<p>Whenever a character vector appears, it does not influence resulting sq type.
Each element is treated as separate sequence. If any of letters in this
vector does not appear in resulting alphabet, it is silently replaced with
<code>NA</code>.
</p>
<p>Due to R dispatch mechanism passing character vector as first will return
class-less list. This behavior is effectively impossible and definitely
unrecommended to fix, as fixing it would involve changing <code>c</code> primitive.
If such possibility is necessary, <code>vec_c</code> is a better
alternative.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>sq</code> object with length equal to sum of
lengths of individual objects passed as parameters. Elements of
<code>sq</code> are concatenated just as if they were normal
lists (see <code>c</code>).
</p>

<code>==.sq()</code>,
<code>get_sq_lengths()</code>,
