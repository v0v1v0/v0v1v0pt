<h2>Simulated Cohort Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Simulated data based on 'true_sim' of a European child-and-youth cohort study with three waves
<code>(t0, t1 and t2)</code>. See Andrews et al. (2021) &lt;https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13395&gt;
for more information on how the data were generated.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>
