<h2>
Parameters describing the output from a treeClust fit
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function produces a list that is used as input to <code>treeClust</code>
to determine which items are preserved in the output.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">treeClust.control(return.trees = FALSE, return.mat = TRUE, 
 return.dists = FALSE, return.newdata = FALSE, cluster.only = FALSE, 
 serule = 0, DevRatThreshold = 1, parallelnodes = 1, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>return.trees</code></td>
<td>

<p>If TRUE, all the trees that go into the object are returned. This can make
the treeClust object very large. Default FALSE.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>return.mat</code></td>
<td>

<p>If TRUE, return a matrix describing leaf membership. Default TRUE.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>return.dists</code></td>
<td>

<p>If TRUE, return an object of class 'dissimilarity' giving all pairwise distances
between observations. This can be very large for large datasets. Default FALSE.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cluster.only</code></td>
<td>

<p>If TRUE, return only the clustering vector, which names the cluster into which
each observation is places. Default FALSE.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>return.newdata</code></td>
<td>

<p>If TRUE, return a numeric matrix describing leaf membership and/or inter-point
distance (see "Details"). Default FALSE.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>serule</code></td>
<td>

<p>Describes how to prune the rpart trees. By default, each tree is pruned to the
minimum error size. With serule &gt; 0, each tree is pruned to the smallest size 
for which the cross-validated error is less than (min error) + (serule * sds).
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>DevRatThreshold</code></td>
<td>

<p>Trees whose deviance ratio is greater than this number are presumed to have
arisen from redundant variables. The predictor at the tree's root is dropped,
a new tree built, and the new deviance ratio computed.
this process is repeated until the resulting tree has deviance ratio less
than or equal to the threshold. Default: 1 (do not drop any such trees).
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>parallelnodes</code></td>
<td>

<p>Describes whether to use parallel processing by creating a "computing cluster"
containing "parallelnodes" nodes. If that number is = 1 no cluster is created. 
Here "cluster" is referring to a set of nodes operating in parallel, 
not to the clustering of the data.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>

<p>Other arguments, passed onto the output.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The "newdata" item is a numeric matrix that gives inter-point distances whose form depends
on the "d.num" argument to treeClust(). When d.num = 1, each tree contributes a set of 0-1 dummy
variables that serve as leaf membership indicators, and with d.num = 2, each tree's indicators
are multiplied by that tree's "strength." With d.num = 3, a tree with k leaves contributes
k-choose-2 columns, with the distances between distinct rows matching the d3 distances, and
likewise with d.num = 4, a tree with k leaves produced k-choose-2 columns that have been
weighted by tree strength.
