<h2>Model Fit Object Information</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An object with class "cluster_fit" is a container for information about a
model that has been fit to the data.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The following model types are implemented in tidyclust:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> K-Means in <code>k_means()</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Hierarchical (Agglomerative) Clustering in <code>hier_clust()</code>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The main elements of the object are:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>spec</code>: A <code>cluster_spec</code> object.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>fit</code>: The object produced by the fitting function.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>preproc</code>: This contains any data-specific information required to
process new a sample point for prediction. For example, if the underlying
model function requires arguments <code>x</code> and the user passed a formula to
<code>fit</code>, the <code>preproc</code> object would contain items such as the terms object
and so on. When no information is required, this is <code>NA</code>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As discussed in the documentation for <code>cluster_spec</code>, the original
arguments to the specification are saved as quosures. These are evaluated for
the <code>cluster_fit</code> object prior to fitting. If the resulting model object
prints its call, any user-defined options are shown in the call preceded by a
tilde (see the example below). This is a result of the use of quosures in the
specification.
</p>
<p>This class and structure is the basis for how <span class="pkg">tidyclust</span> stores model
objects after seeing the data and applying a model.
