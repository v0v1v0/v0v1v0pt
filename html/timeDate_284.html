<p>what to include, a character string. The default is to return all

</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>holidayNYSE</code> generates a list of the clossing days of the
exchange for the requested years.
</p>
<p>The default is to return all closing days (holidays and
specials). <code>type = "standard"</code> requests only closings associated
with the standard public holidays, <code>type = "special"</code> gives the
special closings only.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>an object of class <code>"timeDate"</code>
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The list of closing days returned by <code>holidayNYSE</code> was changed in
<span class="pkg">timeDate</span> version 4021.105, in that previously it did not include
special closing days. This was perceived by some users as buggy. Also,
the intent by the authors of the package seems to have been for it to
return all closing days. Indeed, the default for <code>isisBizday()</code>
is to drop weekends and days returned by <code>holidayNYSE</code>.
</p>
<p>Argument <code>type</code> was also included in version 4021.105. The old
behaviour can be obtained by using <code>type = "standard"</code>.
</p>
<p>The default for argument <code>type</code> is currently the empty string,
since I couldn't come up with another string that would be universally
easy to remember. Suggestions are welcome but a change will be only
feasible if they come soon.
