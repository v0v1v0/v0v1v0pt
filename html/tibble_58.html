<code>tbl_df</code> class</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>tbl_df</code> class is a subclass of <code>data.frame</code>,
created in order to have different default behaviour. The colloquial term
"tibble" refers to a data frame that has the <code>tbl_df</code> class. Tibble is the
central data structure for the set of packages known as the
<a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/">tidyverse</a>, including
<a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/">dplyr</a>,
<a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot2</a>,
<a href="https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/">tidyr</a>, and
<a href="https://readr.tidyverse.org/">readr</a>.
</p>
<p>The general ethos is that tibbles are lazy and surly: they do less and
complain more than base data.frames. This forces
problems to be tackled earlier and more explicitly, typically leading to code
that is more expressive and robust.
</p>


<h3>Properties of <code>tbl_df</code>
</h3>

<p>Objects of class <code>tbl_df</code> have:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> A <code>class</code> attribute of <code>c("tbl_df", "tbl", "data.frame")</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> A base type of <code>"list"</code>, where each element of the list has the same
<code>vctrs::vec_size()</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> A <code>names</code> attribute that is a character vector the same length as the
underlying list.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> A <code>row.names</code> attribute, included for compatibility with data.frame.
This attribute is only consulted to query the number of rows,
any row names that might be stored there are ignored
by most tibble methods.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Behavior of <code>tbl_df</code>
</h3>

<p>How default behaviour of tibbles differs from that of
data.frames, during creation and access:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Column data is not coerced. A character vector is not turned into a factor.
List-columns are expressly anticipated and do not require special tricks.
Internal names are never stripped from column data.
Read more in <code>tibble()</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Recycling only happens for a length 1 input.
Read more in <code>vctrs::vec_recycle()</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Column names are not munged, although missing names are auto-populated.
Empty and duplicated column names are strongly discouraged, but the user
must indicate how to resolve. Read more in <code>vctrs::vec_as_names()</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Row names are not added and are strongly discouraged, in favor of storing
that info as a column. Read about in rownames.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>df[, j]</code> returns a tibble; it does not automatically extract the column
inside. <code>df[, j, drop = FALSE]</code> is the default. Read more in subsetting.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> There is no partial matching when <code>$</code> is used to index by name. <code>df$name</code>
for a nonexistent name generates a warning. Read more in subsetting.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>See <code>vignette("invariants")</code> for a detailed description of the behavior.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, printing and inspection are a very high priority.
The goal is to convey as much information as possible, in a concise way,
even for large and complex tibbles. Read more in formatting.
