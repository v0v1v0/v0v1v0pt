<h2>Screening of site by taxa matrix</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Screens site by taxa matrix for potential minimum occurrence and frequency
problems.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">txa.screen(txa, minSplt = minSplt, messaging = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>txa</code></td>
<td>
<p>A site by taxon matrix of sampled counts at each sampling
location.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>minSplt</code></td>
<td>
<p>The minimum split size used for partitioning.  The default is
to use the argument form the original TITAN function call.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>messaging</code></td>
<td>
<p>If <code>TRUE</code>, provide progress messages.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function provides a warning for low numbers of observations and data
sets with too few observations to make any reasonable interpretation.  It
also warns users when 100 percent occurence is detected and how much of the
data set meets this criterion, as IndVal based analyses are not ideal for
this type of data and we might recommend other techniques (Baker and King
2013). The function also assess whether occurrence frequencies for any taxa
fall below 3, and call attention to very small minimum split sizes.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A site by taxon matrix of sampled counts at each sampling location.
