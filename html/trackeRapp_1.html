<h2>Launch the <span class="pkg">trackeRapp</span> interface</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><span class="pkg">trackeRapp</span> provides an integrated dashboard and workflow for
the analysis of running, cycling and swimming data from GPS-enabled tracking
devices through the <code>trackeR</code> R package. <code>trackerRapp</code> or
<code>trackeR_app</code> launches the interface.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">trackeRapp(quiet = TRUE)

trackeR_app(quiet = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>quiet</code></td>
<td>
<p>If <code>TRUE</code> (default), then warnings and errors
while using the interface are printed in standard output. If
<code>FALSE</code>, then all warnings and errors are suppressed.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Getting started</h3>

<p>Once the interface launches, you may
experiment with the interface by hitting "Load" and then
"Upload sample dataset".
</p>
<p>See the <code>"tour de trackeRapp"</code> pages at
<a href="https://trackerproject.github.io/trackeRapp/">https://trackerproject.github.io/trackeRapp/</a> for tutorial
videos, explanation of the workflow and visualizations that
<span class="pkg">trackeRapp</span> offers, and to, generally, learn more about
<span class="pkg">trackeRapp</span> and all of its capabilities.
