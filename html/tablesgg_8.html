<h2>Identify Adjacent Blocks of Table Cells </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>For each block of table cells in a <code>tblBlocks</code> object, identify the
other blocks that are adjacent to it on each side.  This is an internal
utility function, not intended to be called by package users.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">adjacent_blocks(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A <code>tblBlocks</code> object, defining a collection of rectangular blocks of
cells in a table.
</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A block B is considered adjacent to block A if (a) the blocks do not
intersect (have no cells in common); and (b) the blocks touch along at
least part of one edge (they span overlapping sets of rows in adjacent
columns, or overlapping sets of columns in adjacent rows).
</p>
<p>It requires storage and time proportional to the square of the number of
blocks.  For realistic tables this is not likely to be a problem.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list array with one row per block in <code>x</code>, and four columns.  The
rows are named by the block <code>id</code>, and the columns as "top", "right",
"bottom", and "left".  Element <code>[[i, j]]</code> is a character vector
containing the ID's of all blocks that are adjacent to block <code>i</code> on
side <code>j</code>.  If there are no adjacent blocks, the element is
<code>character(0)</code>.
