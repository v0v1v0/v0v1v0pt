<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Functions for accessing and manipulating spatial data for animal
tracking, with straightforward coercion from and to other formats. Filter
for speed and create time spent maps from animal track data. There are
coercion methods to convert between 'trip' and 'ltraj' from 'adehabitatLT',
and between 'trip' and 'psp' and 'ppp' from 'spatstat'. Trip objects
can be created from raw or grouped data frames, and from types in the 'sp',
'sf', 'amt', 'trackeR', and other packages.
