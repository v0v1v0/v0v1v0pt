<h2>A data set created by merging 1) data from a "gold standard" survey and 2) data from
other surveys of the same universe. Data from the "gold standard" survey are assumed to
be the survey universe's "actual" response; data from the other surveys have survey
error which the functions in 'TSEind' can calculate. Data are organized by survey
(columns) and survey question (rows), and their values are the aggregate, "topline"
responses to the survey questions which can range from 1 to 99 (the scale used
by each survey question).</h2>
