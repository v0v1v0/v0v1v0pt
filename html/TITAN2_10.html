<h2>Calculate permuted IndVal scores using a group matrix</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function performs the same calculations as 'indval' or 'indvals', but
does so using matrix operations on a set of binary group assignments in
matrix form. Function 'indvalps' calculates indicator value scores using a
modification of Dufrene and Legendre (1997), whereby relative abundance is
computed as total relative abundance across groups rather than as mean
relative abundance.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">indvalp(grpMatrix, spp)

indvalps(grpMatrix, spp)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>grpMatrix</code></td>
<td>
<p>A site-by-permutation matrix of binary (0,1) assignments
indicating group membership for successive randomizations of rows of 'spp'
according to a ranks of an environmental variable.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>spp</code></td>
<td>
<p>A site-by-taxon matrix of taxa counts at each sampling location.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Although the 'indval' function is reasonably efficient for a single
calculation, when repeated during permutations (default = 250) and again
during for each bootstrap replicate (default = 500), small differences in
processing time can quickly become unwieldy. Even with the matrix operation,
the permutation accounts for &gt; 3/4 of processing time for most data sets (due
to the fact that it is repeated for each bootstrap replicate).
</p>
<p>The output matrix does not include information about the group membership of
indval maxima because this information is not used in the permutation
procedure (i.e., only the distribution of IndVal magnitudes is relevant).
</p>
<p>Modification of the original IndVal method was developed to address potential
for bias in change point identification for highly skewed samples. This and
the function 'indvals' are run when the argument 'ivTot' in the original
TITAN function call is TRUE.  It is expected that 'indval' and 'indvalp' will
be used more commonly.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A matrix (ivmax) of IndVal maxima across each partition with nrow
equal to the number of permutations and ncol equal to the number of taxa in
'spp'.
