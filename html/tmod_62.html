<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Transcriptomic responses to vaccination
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>Data frame with one row per gene containing log fold changes and FDR (q
values) for the Fluad vaccine as compared to placebo on day 0, day 1, day 2
and day 3 after the vaccination.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data shows the time course of transcriptomic responses to influenza
vaccination in healthy volunteers. The source of the data is 
GEO project PRJNA515032, associated with the following paper:
</p>
<p>Weiner, January, et al. "Characterization of potential
biomarkers of reactogenicity of licensed antiviral vaccines: randomized
controlled clinical trials conducted by the BIOVACSAFE consortium."
Scientific reports 9.1 (2019): 1-14.
</p>
<p>For the data set, 3000 genes with top variance were chosen.
