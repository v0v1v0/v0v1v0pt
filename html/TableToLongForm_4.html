<h2>
Example hierarchical Tables
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A list containing a number of example Tables that can be converted to
LongForm dataframes by TableToLongForm. Each Tables is stored as a
character matrix.
</p>
<p>These datasets are generally not immediately useful as data, as they
must first be converted (e.g. by using TableToLongForm).
</p>
<p>If the user prefers to have these data in their Global Environment
rather than nested inside a single list, they can use
<code>attach(TCData)</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(TCData)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>list containing character matrices of varying size.
