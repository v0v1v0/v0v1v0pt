<h2>Beans</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Experiment performed at UC-Davis; fifteen students participated.  Each
student was asked to place as many beans into a cup as he/she could, in 15
seconds.  Each student performed this task once with the dominant hand, and
once with the non-dominant hand, but the order of performance was randomized.
The purpose of the study was to see whether manual dexterity was better for
the dominant hand.  Terminology: your dominant hand is the hand you use the
most.
