<h2>Lindner Center data on 996 PCI patients analyzed by Kereiakes et al. (2000)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These data are adapted from the <code>lindner</code> dataset in the <code>USPS</code> package.
The description comes from that package, except for the variable <code>sixMonthSurvive</code>, which 
is a recode of <code>lifepres</code>
</p>
<p>Data from an observational study of 996 patients receiving an initial
Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) at Ohio Heart Health, Christ Hospital,
Cincinnati in 1997 and followed for at least 6 months by the staff of the Lindner Center.
The patients thought to be more severely diseased were assigned to treatment with abciximab
(an expensive, high-molecular-weight IIb/IIIa cascade blocker); in fact, only 298 (29.9
percent) of patients received usual-care-alone with their initial PCI.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(lindner)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame of 10 variables collected on 996 patients; no NAs.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>lifepres</dt>
<dd>
<p>Mean life years preserved due to survival for at least 6 months following
PCI; numeric value of either 11.4 or 0.</p>
</dd>
<dt>cardbill</dt>
<dd>
<p>Cardiac related costs incurred within 6 months of patient's initial PCI;
numeric value in 1998 dollars; costs were truncated by death for the 26 patients with
lifepres == 0.</p>
</dd>
<dt>abcix</dt>
<dd>
<p>Numeric treatment selection indicator; 0 implies usual PCI care alone; 1
implies usual PCI care deliberately augmented by either planned or rescue treatment
with abciximab.</p>
</dd>
<dt>stent</dt>
<dd>
<p>Coronary stent deployment; numeric, with 1 meaning YES and 0 meaning NO.</p>
</dd>
<dt>height</dt>
<dd>
<p>Height in centimeters; numeric integer from 108 to 196.</p>
</dd>
<dt>female</dt>
<dd>
<p>Female gender; numeric, with 1 meaning YES and 0 meaning NO.</p>
</dd>
<dt>diabetic</dt>
<dd>
<p>Diabetes mellitus diagnosis; numeric, with 1 meaning YES and 0 meaning NO.</p>
</dd>
<dt>acutemi</dt>
<dd>
<p>Acute myocardial infarction within the previous 7 days; numeric, with 1
meaning YES and 0 meaning NO.</p>
</dd>
<dt>ejecfrac</dt>
<dd>
<p>Left ejection fraction; numeric value from 0 percent to 90 percent.</p>
</dd>
<dt>ves1proc</dt>
<dd>
<p>Number of vessels involved in the patient's initial PCI procedure; numeric
integer from 0 to 5.</p>
</dd>
<dt>sixMonthSurvive</dt>
<dd>
<p>Survival at six months â€” a recoded version of <code>lifepres</code>.</p>
</dd>   
</dl>
