<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">decoy
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 3320 rows and 3 variables:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> subject
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> workroom: The room for which the sanitizer weight is recorded.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> value: The weight in grams for the sanitizer.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This series of experiments was published in
an article in Psychological Science in 2018. Subsequently, Frank Yu, Leif
Nelson, and Uri Simonsohn argued that the data for the experiments could
not be <a href="http://datacolada.org/74">trusted</a>,and Simonsohn developed
number-bunching in relation to his analysis of the <a href="http://datacolada.org/77">data</a>.
The article was eventually
<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797618761374">retracted</a>. This data
frame consists of the data contained in the tab named "Study3-sanitizer usage(grams)".
