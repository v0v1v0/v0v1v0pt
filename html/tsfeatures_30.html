<h2>Partial autocorrelation-based features</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Computes various measures based on partial autocorrelation coefficients of the
original series, first-differenced series and second-differenced series
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">pacf_features(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<p>a univariate time series</p>
</td>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A vector of 3 values: Sum of squared of first 5
partial autocorrelation coefficients of the original series, first differenced
series and twice-differenced series.
For seasonal data, the partial autocorrelation coefficient at the first seasonal
lag is also returned.
