<h2>
Match Arbitrary Class Assignments Across Methods
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These functions provide a set of tools to find the best match between
the labels used by two different algorithms to cluster the same set of
samples.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">labelMatcher(tab, verbose = FALSE)
matchLabels(tab)
countAgreement(tab)
labelAccuracy(data, labels, linkage="ward.D2")
bestMetric(data, labels)
remap(fix, vary)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tab</code></td>
<td>
<p>A contingency table, represented as a square <code>matrix</code>
or <code>table</code> as an R object.  Both dimensions represent an
assignment of class labels, with each row and column representing
one of the labels.  Entries should be non-negative integer counts of
the number of objects having the labels represented by the row and
column.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical value; should the routine print something out
periodically so you know it's still working?</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>A matrix whose columns represent objects to be clustered
and whose rows represent the anonymous features used to perform the
clustering.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>labels</code></td>
<td>
<p>A factor (or character vector) of class labels for the
objects in the <code>data</code> matrix.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>linkage</code></td>
<td>
<p>A linkage rule accepted by the <code>hclust</code>
function.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fix</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of cluater assignments.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>vary</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of cluater assignments.</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In the most general sense, clustering can be viewed as a function from
the space of "objects" of interest into a space of "class labels".  In
less mathematical terms, this simply means that each object gets
assigned an (arbitrary) class label. This is all well-and-good until
you try to compare the results of running two different clustering
algorithms that use different labels (or even worse, use the same
labels – typically the integers <code class="reqn">1, 2, \dots, K</code> – with
different meanings).  When that happens, you need a way to decide
which labels from the different sets are closest to meaning the
"same thing".
</p>
<p>That's where this set of functions comes in. The core algorithm is
implemented in the function <code>labelMatcher</code>, which works on a
contingency table whose entries <code class="reqn">N_{ij}</code> are the number of samples
with row-label = <code class="reqn">i</code> and column-label = <code class="reqn">j</code>.  To find  the
best match, one computes (heuristically) the values <code class="reqn">F_{ij}</code> that
describe the fraction of all entries in row <code class="reqn">i</code> and column <code class="reqn">j</code>
represented by <code class="reqn">N_{ij}</code>.  Perfectly matched labels would consist
of a row <code class="reqn">i</code> and a column <code class="reqn">j</code> where <code class="reqn">N_{ij}</code> is the only
nonzero entry in its row and column, so <code class="reqn">F_{ij} = 1</code>. The largest
value for <code class="reqn">F_{ij}</code> (with ties broken simply by which entry is
closer to the upper-left corner of the matrix) defines the best
match. The matched row and column are then removed from the matrix and
the process repeats recursively.
</p>
<p>We apply this method to determine which distance metric, when used in
hierarchical clustering, best matches a "gold standard" set of class
labels.  (These may not really be gold, of course; they can also be a
set of labels determined by k-means or another clustering algorithm.)
The idea is to cluster the samples using a variety of different
metrics, and select the one whose label assignments best macth the
standard.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The <code>labelMatcher</code> function returns a list of two vectors of the
same length.  These contain the matched label-indices, in the order
they were matched by the algorithm.
</p>
<p>The <code>matchLabels</code> function is a user-friendly front-end to the
<code>labelmatcher</code> function.  It returns a matrix, with the rows and
columns reordered so the labels match.
</p>
<p>The <code>countAgreement</code> function returns an integer, the number of
samples with the "same" labels, computed by summing the diagonal of
the reordered matrix produced by <code>matchLabels</code>.
</p>
<p>The <code>labelAccuracy</code> function returns a vector indexed by the set
of nine distance metrics hard-coded in the function.  Each entry is
the fraction of samples whose hierarchical clusters match the
prespecified <code>labels</code>.
</p>
<p>The <code>bestMetric</code> function is a user-friendly front-end to the
<code>labelAccuracy</code> function.  It returns the name of the distance
metric whose hierarchical clusters best match the prespecified
<code>labels</code>.
</p>
<p>The <code>remap</code> function takes two sets of integer cluster
assignments and returns a new set of labels for the target that best
matches the source.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The <code>labelAccuracy</code> function should probably allow the user
to supply a list of distance metrics instead of relying on the
hard-coded list internally.</p>

<p>Hierarchical clustering is implemented in the <code>hclust</code>
function.  We use the extended set of distance metrics provided by the
<code>distanceMatrix</code> function from the ClassDiscovery package.
This set includes all of the  metrics from the <code>dist</code>
funciton.
