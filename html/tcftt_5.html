<h2>tcftt: Two-Sample Tests for Skewed Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The classical two-sample t-test works well for the normally distributed data or data with large sample size.
The tcfu() and tt() tests implemented in this package provide better type I error control with more accurate power
when testing the equality of two-sample means for skewed populations having
unequal variances. The approximation is especially useful when the sample sizes are moderate. The tcfu()
uses the Cornish-Fisher expansion to achieve a better approximation to the
true percentiles. The tt() provides transformations of the Welch's t-statistic so that the
sampling distribution become more symmetric. For more technical details, please
refer to Zhang (2019) &lt;http://hdl.handle.net/2097/40235&gt;.

<h3>tcftt functions</h3>

<p>The function 'tcfu()' implements the Cornish-Fisher based two-sample test (TCFU)
and 'tt()' implements the transformation based two-sample test (TT).
The function 't_edgeworth()' provides the Edgeworth expansion for
cumulative distribution function for the Welch's t-statistic, and 't_cornish_fisher()'
provides the Cornish-Fisher expansion for the percentiles.
The functions 'adjust_power()' and 'pauc()' provide power adjustment
for simulation studies so that the actual size of the tests are within the significance level.
