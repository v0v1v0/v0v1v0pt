<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>tabr</code> package provides a music notation syntax and a collection of music
programming functions for generating, manipulating, organizing and analyzing
musical information in R. The music notation framework facilitates creating
and analyzing music data in notation form.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Music syntax can be entered directly in character strings, for example to
quickly transcribe short pieces of music. The package contains functions for
directly performing various mathematical, logical and organizational
operations and musical transformations on special object classes that
facilitate working with music data and notation. The same music data can be
organized in tidy data frames for a familiar and powerful approach to the
analysis of large amounts of structured music data. Functions are available
for mapping seamlessly between these formats and their representations of
musical information.
</p>
<p>The package also provides an API to 'LilyPond' (<a href="https://lilypond.org/">https://lilypond.org/</a>) for
transcribing musical representations in R into tablature ("tabs") and sheet
music. 'LilyPond' is open source music engraving software for generating high
quality sheet music based on markup syntax. The package generates 'LilyPond'
files from R code and can pass them to the 'LilyPond' command line interface
to be rendered into sheet music PDF files or inserted into R markdown
documents.
</p>
<p>The package offers nominal MIDI file output support in conjunction with
rendering sheet music. The package can read MIDI files and attempts to
structure the MIDI data to integrate as best as possible with the data
structures and functionality found throughout the package.
</p>
<p><code>tabr</code> offers a useful but limited LilyPond API and is not intended to
access all LilyPond functionality from R,
nor is transcription via the API the entire scope of <code>tabr</code>.
If you are only creating sheet music on a case by case basis, write your own
LilyPond files manually.
There is no need to use <code>tabr</code> or limit yourself to its existing
LilyPond API.
If you are generating music notation programmatically,
<code>tabr</code> provides the ability to do so in R and has the added benefit of
converting what you write in R code to the LilyPond file format to be
rendered as printable guitar tablature.
</p>
<p>While LilyPond is listed as a system requirement for <code>tabr</code>, you can
use the package for music analysis without installing LilyPond if you do not
intend to render tabs.
