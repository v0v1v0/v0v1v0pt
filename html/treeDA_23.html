<h2>Example dataset</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A small example dataset with three components, stored as a list
with a vector containing the classes (<code>response</code>), a matrix
containing the predictor variables (<code>predictors</code>), and a tree
describing the relationships between the predictor variables
(<code>tree</code>). The dataset consists of 50 samples divided into two
classes and 100 taxa/predictor variables, related to each other by
a random tree (generated with <code>ape::rtree</code>). A set of 42 taxa
descending from one internal node are all over-represented in one
class and under-represented in the other. The <code>predictors</code>
element in the list contains real numbers, not counts, and is
supposed to reflect normalized taxon abundances (e.g.,
normalization using the variance-stabilizing transformation in
DESeq2).

and a tree describing the relationship between the predictor
variables.
