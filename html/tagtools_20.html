<h2>Reduce the sampling rate</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function is used to reduce the sampling rate of a time series by an integer factor.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">decdc(x, df)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data structure, vector or matrix containing the signal(s) to be decimated. If x is a matrix, each column is decimated separately.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>df</code></td>
<td>
<p>The decimation factor. The output sampling rate is the input sampling rate divided by df. df must be an integer greater than 1.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>y The decimated signal vector or matrix. It has the same number of columns as x but has 1/df of the rows.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Decimation is performed by first low-pass filtering x and then keeping 1 sample out of every df. A symmetric FIR filter with length 12*df and cutoff frequency 0.4*fs/df is used. The group delay of the filter is removed. For large decimation factors (e.g., df&gt;&gt;50), it is better to perform several decimations with lower factors. For example to decimate by 120, use: decdc(decdc(x,10),12).
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">s &lt;- matrix(sin(2 * pi / 100 * c(0:1000) - 1), ncol = 1)
plot(c(1:length(s)), s) 
y &lt;- decdc(x = s, df = 4)
plot(c(1:length(y)), y) 

</code></pre>
