<h2>Pinus nigra dataset</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>To study the growth of the wood mass in a cultivated forest of <em>Pinus nigra</em> 
located in the north of Palencia (Spain), a sample of 362 trees was studied. 
The data set is made of measurements of heights (in meters), in variable "HT", 
and diameters (in millimetres), in variable "Diameter", of these trees. 
The presence of three linear groups can be guessed apart from a small group 
of trees forming its own cluster with larger heights and diameters one isolated 
tree with the largest diameter but small height. More details on the 
interpretation of this dataset in García-Escudero et al (2010).
