<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Options for tiler package.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">tiler_options(...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list of options.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>On Windows systems, if the system paths for <code>python.exe</code> and <code>OSGeo4W.bat</code>
are not added to the system PATH variable, they must be provided by the user
after loading the package. It is recommended to add these to the system path
so they do not need to be specified for every R session.
</p>
<p>As long as you are using OSGeo4W, you can ignore the Python path
specification and do not even need to install it on your system separately;
OSGeo4W will use its own built-in version.
</p>
<p>The recommended way to have GDAL available to Python in Windows is to
install <a href="https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/">OSGeo4W</a>. This is commonly
installed along with
<a href="https://qgis.org/download/">QGIS</a>.
</p>
<p>By default, <code>tiler_options()</code> is set on package load with
<code>osgeo4w = "OSGeo4W.bat"</code>. It is expected that the user has added the path to
this file to the system PATH variable in Windows. For example, if it is
installed to <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠C:/OSGeo4W64/OSGeo4W.bat⁠</code>, add <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠C:/OSGeo4W64⁠</code> to your PATH. If
you do want to specify the path in the R session using <code>tiler_options()</code>,
provide the full path including the filename. See the example.
</p>
<p>None of this applies to other systems. As long as the system requirements,
Python and GDAL, are installed, then <code>tile()</code> should generate tiles without
getting or setting any <code>tiler_options()</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The function prints all set options if called with no arguments.
When setting options, nothing is returned.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">tiler_options()
tiler_options(osgeo4w = "C:/OSGeo4W64/OSGeo4W.bat")
</code></pre>
