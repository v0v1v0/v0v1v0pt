<h2>Resamples an input DTM to generate new DTMs</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Takes any DTM and randomly resamples from each row, creating a new DTM
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">dtm_resampler(dtm, alpha = NULL, n = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dtm</code></td>
<td>
<p>Document-term matrix with terms as columns. Works with DTMs
produced by any popular text analysis package, or you can use the
<code>dtm_builder()</code> function.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>alpha</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number indicating proportion of document lengths, e.g.,
<code>alpha = 1</code> returns resampled rows that are the same lengths
as the original DTM.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n</code></td>
<td>
<p>Integer indicating the length of documents to be returned, e.g.,
<code>n = 100L</code> will bring documents shorter than 100 tokens up to 100,
while bringing documents longer than 100 tokens down to 100.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Using the row counts as probabilities, each document's tokens are resampled
with replacement up to a certain proportion of the row count (set by alpha).
This function can be used with iteration to "bootstrap" a DTM without
returning to the raw text. It does not iterate, however, so operations can
be performed on one DTM at a time without storing multiple DTMs in memory.
</p>
<p>If <code>alpha</code> is less than 1, then a proportion of each documents' lengths is
returned. For example, <code>alpha = 0.50</code> will return a resampled DTM where each
row has half the tokens of the original DTM. If <code>alpha = 2</code>, than each row in
the resampled DTM twice the number of tokens of the original DTM.
If an integer is provided to <code>n</code> then all documents will be resampled to that
length. For example, <code>n = 2000L</code> will resample each document until they are
2000 tokens long â€“ meaning those shorter than 2000 will be increased in
length, while those longer than 2000 will be decreased in length. <code>alpha</code>
and <code>n</code> should not be specified at the same time.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>returns a document-term matrix of class "dgCMatrix"
