<h2>
Find transmission ratio of minor alleles in mother, father or both parents.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculate the transmission ratio of the minor allele from parents to offspring for case- and control-trios, in mother, father, or both parents. Minor allele normally refers to the disease allele, which has lower frequency than the alternative allele(s). Note that trios with missing data are discarded.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">find.t(sample)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sample</code></td>
<td>

<p>case- and/or control-trios dataset with first column as disease status (1=case, 0=control), the second, third and forth columns as maternal, paternal and child genotypes. The fifth column, if entered as part of the input data, is the parent-of-origin indicator of disease allele in a heterozygous child (a value of 1 indicates the mother transmitted the disease allele and 0 indicates the father transmitted). The parent-of-origin indicator is only meaningful for a heterozygous child.
