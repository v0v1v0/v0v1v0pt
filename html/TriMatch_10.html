<h2>This method will return at least one treatment from groups one and two within
the caliper.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This method will attempt to return enough rows to use each treatment (the first
two groups in the matching order) at least once. Assuming treat1 is the first
group in the match order and treat2 the second, all duplicate treat1 rows
are removed. Next, all treat2 units not in present in after removing duplicate
treat1 units are identified. For each of those treat2 units, the matched
triplet with the smallest overall distances where treat2 is one of the mathched
units is retained.
